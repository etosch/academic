I was delighted to visit UNH and longtime colleague [Laura Dietz](https://www.cs.unh.edu/~dietz/) to talk about formal language support for experimentation as part of the [Robotics Seminar Series](https://ceps.unh.edu/computer-science/opportunities/robotics-seminar-series). Empiricism and evaluation methodology is important across the board in science, and it was fun to share the ways in which we can better support reproducibile data collection in the context of experimentation. It also doesn't hurt to have a secret ally to evangelize the power of formal languages via [Ben Gamari](https://bgamari.github.io).
