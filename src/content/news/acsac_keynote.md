I gave the [keynote](https://www.openconf.org/acsac2022/modules/request.php?module=oc_program&action=page.php&id=15#Reproducibility) talk at the [Learning from Authoritative Security Experiment Results](https://laser-workshop.org/index.html) at the [Annual Computer Security Applications Conference](https://www.acsac.org), organized by [David Balenson](http://www.csl.sri.com/people/balenson/).
<!-- I met so many lovely people working on very cool problems. It was also very fun and gratifying to meet David and Jay in person! This was the first conference to feel like the beforetimes and it was better than a fresh cup of single-origin light roast pourover coffee (the highest of praise!).  -->
