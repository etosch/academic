**Background**: I have been working with longtime collaborators [John Foley](https://jjfoley.me/), [Kaleigh Clary](https://cs.umass.edu/~kclary), and [David Jensen](https://cs.umass.edu/~jensen) on developing a new testing framework for reinforcement learning. I designed a prototype version that my collaborators and I used to investigate the behavior of generalized agents in our work, [Measuring and Characterizing Generalization in Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.02868.pdf). I presented Toybox at the IBM AI Systems Day and as a poster at the 2018 NeurIPS Systems for ML Workshop. 

**Current project**: I am currently revising work that seeks to explain agent behavior in time-varying relational environments and would welcome efforts from students who might be interested in causal reasoning, experimentation, or explanation for autonomtous agents. **As this work is not currently core to my research agenda, I would only consider working with exceptionally motivated collaborators on this project.** While a background in machine learning and reinforcement learning will undoubtedly be helpful, solid software engineering skills are far more important for this work. If you'd like to discuss project possibilities, [reach out](mailto:e.tosch@northeastern.edu) and/or [schedule](/https://calendly.com/etosch/30min) a meeting with me.
