This is a very new project! I am working with incoming PhD advisee [Dorsa Mohammadi Arezooji](https://dorsa-arezooji.github.io/) on a new domain in the nascent PL+Law field. We are inspired by Basu et al.'s _[Property Conveyances as Programming Languages](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3359591.3359734)_. We are currently investigating two domains: arbitration agreements in EULAs and insurance contracts. We are seeking out domain experts in the legal field and have outlined projects in NLP and user comprehension of privacy concerns. We look forward to attending the [ProLaLa workshop](https://popl22.sigplan.org/home/prolala-2022) and connecting with collaborators.
