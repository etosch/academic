This is where I will be posting partially-formed research thoughts when I'm not spending all of my writing time on papers or grants. I suspect it will be mostly posts about conferences and calls into the void for context or clarification that will go unanswered. [Research blogging was much easier in graduate school](https://blog.emmatosch.com). :D
