Emma Tosch is an Assistant Professor of [Computer Science](https://www.uvm.edu/cems/cs) in the [College of Engineering and Mathematical Sciences](https://www.uvm.edu/cems) at the [University of Vermont](https://www.uvm.edu). She works in *applied programming languages (PL) research*, where she treats the process of language formalization &mdash; especially the design of domain-specific languages &mdash; as a methodological approach to problems not ordinarily considered the domain of PL. She is particularly interested in building languages and tools for data scientists and social scientsts.

Tosch's primary interests are in PL applications to data collection and analysis for social science domains. Her early work on [SurveyMan](http://surveyman.emmatosch.com) &mdash; a language and framework for designing, debugging, and deploying surveys &mdash; has won first place in the [2014 ACM student research competition at PLDI](https://src.acm.org/winners/2015), a best paper award at OOPSLA 2014, and a [2015 Outstanding Synthesis Award](https://www.cics.umass.edu/oaa2015) in the [College of Computer and Information Sciences](https://cics.umass.edu) at the [University of Massachusetts](https://www.umass.edu). Her recent work on [PlanAlyzer](https://github.com/KDL-umass/PlanAlyzer) &mdash; a static analysis tool for programmatically-defined experiments &mdash; was recognized as a [SIGPLAN research highlight](https://blog.sigplan.org/2020/09/01/2019-sigplan-research-highlight-awards/) in 2020 and was honored as a [Research Highlight](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2021/9/255047-planalyzer) in the September 2021 issue of the [Communications of the ACM](https://cacm.acm.org). 

<!-- Tosch has additionally worked in question answering (natural language processing), evolutionary computation, and explainable AI and has research interests in causal inference.  -->

Emma Tosch earned her B.A in English Literature from Wellesley College in 2008 before working at a healthcare IT start up. She obtained a post-baccalaureate certificate and M.A. in Computer Science from Brandeis University in 2011 before earning her PhD from the University of Massachusetts Amherst in 2020.
