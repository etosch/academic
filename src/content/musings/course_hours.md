When it comes to teaching, we tend to view "support" in terms of staff or existing teaching materials. However, there are other factors that can help as well. One area where I, as a junior faculty member, would have liked to have had more support, is in understanding (1) how much time it was reasonable to expect students to spend on my courses and (2) how to select pre-requisites in service of ensuring that students would be able to devote the appropriate amount of time to the course.<!-- more -->

# Instructional Time vs. Student Focus-Hours

My teaching experience prior to UVM was for a large required course at UMass. This course has copious resources associated with it and I had TA'ed it twice - I knew the rhythm 

I've been thinking about this problem recently. As part of my postdoc, I am learning Answer Set Programming (ASP); this is a kind of constraint/logic programming that is suitable for capturing modal logics. While I was teaching [my AI course](https://etosch.github.io/CS295A-S22/), I had a hard time finding suitable introductory programming exercises for students in modal logic. As I've been playing around with [clingo](https://potassco.org/clingo/), I've been porting a worksheet I developed for that course into ASP and it's gotten me thinking about how I might change that course, were I to teach it again. 

Now, during my time at UVM, all of the courses I taught, I taught _de novo_: I didn't have a reference syllabus and had to develop all of my materials from scratch. For the AI course, I was at least able to pull some problems from a logic textbook I liked and leveraged my past experience teaching discrete probability theory and its applications, which made generating quizzes, homeworks, and exams a little easier. 

I'm bringing up the effort of generating materials because, in teaching 3x/week and starting the courses from scratch, I couldn't really use a function of the amount of time it would take me to solve a problem as a proxy for estimating the amount of time it would take a student to solve a problem. In other fields where there are textbooks, in the worst case, faculty might only have a partial solutions manual and can use a heuristic for estimating the
