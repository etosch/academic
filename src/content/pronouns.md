As of this writing, it is my understanding that best practices for fostering gender identity inclusion involves stating one's pronouns and that doing so normalizes the spectrum of gender identity. I like this idea of this, but have felt resistence to doing so due to my own personal baggage around gender identity. 

I won't get into the details, since they are banal AF and not really the point. The main ideas I want to convey are:

1. Ideologically I am very happy to move into a world where we only use they/them.
2. I worry that cis people using they/them is co-opting a queer space.
3. I cannot separate my feelings about the social status of women from my feelings about living in the world as a woman.

Finally, despite my preferred pronouns being she/her, please do not feel the need to feminize any terms around me. I know this is a contentious issue, but if you haven't shifted your vocabulary to gender-neutral terms, do not substitute in feminized versions because I happen to be in the room. It sounds ridiculous and serves as a reminder that my presence is a cognitive burden. Be cool.
