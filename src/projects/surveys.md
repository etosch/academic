_What are the tradeoffs between detecting adversaries and protecting privacy in survey design?_

## Backstory! 
Early in my PhD, I designed a table-based programming language and runtime system to design, debug, and deploy scientific surveys on the web. With my project adivsor, I collaborated with folks from the Linguistics department. I first presented [SurveyMan](https://surveyman.emmatosch.com) at the 2014 Off the Beaten Track workshop. This work won first place at the 2014 PLDI Student Research Competition, a best paper award at OOPSLA 2014, and a 2015 Outstanding Synthesis Award at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. UVM PhD student [Michael McConnell](https://www.uvm.edu/~mvmcconn/) resurrected this work with an interest in applying quantitative information flow to surveys to protect potentially vulnerable populations. 

## Current status 

As a result of serendipitous opportunitites afforded by my UVM colleagues [Joe Near](https://uvm.edu/~jnear), I had returned to this work due to the confluence of student interest in privacy, natural language processing, and biased data collection. Upon leaving UVM, I had to put this work on hold, but am keen to work on it again.

## Future projects
The release of tools that leverage large langauge models have made some of the more labor-intenstive aspects of this work potentially much lighter. If you would like to discuss further, please [reach out](mailto:e.tosch@northeastern.edu).
