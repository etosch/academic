Choosing the wrong forms of address is the fastest way to make a bad 
impression over email. However, it is one based on norms and therefore 
is not typically explicitly taught. 

In the general case, we can capture how you should choose the form of 
address via flow chart:

                        --------    
                        | Prof.|

If you do not know the answers to these questions, take a minute or 
two to search the internet to try to find out. If you are still unsure, 
pick the most formal title that is appropriate given the context. For 
example, in a university setting, choose "Prof." If you are writing to 
someone who works in a field that has many people with doctorates, 
choose "Dr."

## Prof. vs. Dr.
This one can cause some confusion: not all folks who have doctorates 
work in universities, and not all folks who work in universities have
doctorates. 

Outside of a university, you may start by assuming that anyone who does
industrial research has a PhD and thus should be referred to as "Dr." Inside
a university, you may assume that anyone who teaches should be referred to 
as "Prof." Some people who teach in a university may have the title 
"Lecturer" or "Instructor." If you don't know the culture of forms of 
address at the institution of the person you are addressing, default to
the most formal form and let the person you are writing to correct you.

## How students should address professors
When unsure, students should always choose the most formal form of address.
This is a sign of respect; not adhering to this rule sends a signal about
a lack or respect or an assumed familiarity that the recipient may not 
be comfortable with.

In computer science, students are often encouraged to refer to faculty
by their first names. This practice may not carry over to other disciplines.

If someone refers to themselves using a different name or title in response 
to an email, you should feel comfortable using that name or form of address
in future emails. 

## How professors address each other
A professor may refer to another professor by first name. As mentioned
above, in computer science, it is normal for everyone to be on a first-name
basis. However, in the general case you should not assume the form of 
address one professor uses to talk about another carries over to students. 

I will generally address other professors/lecturers/instructors at my 
home institution by first name. I will also address 
professors/lecturers/instructors in computer science at other institutions
by first name. However, I will generally use titles when addressing 
professionals at other universities who are not in my discipline. This is
done to signal deference and a lack of familiarity with other disciplines'
cultural norms.

## Why forms of address matter
It can sometimes feel like forms of address enforce a heirarchy or about 
"showing off" credentials. If you feel this way, ask yourself: why?[^3]

As mentioned above, forms of address are signs of respect. They are also
about setting boundaries, and communicating expected boundaries. For 
example, if you address me as "Ms.," I assume that you know little to
nothing about me, professionally. The only people who call me "Ms." are
trying to sell me something. :) 

There are many groups of people who have historically been excluded from
higher education, from having the possibility of earning titles like "Prof."
and "Dr." When folks (especially students!) fail to use these titles, it 
can feel like they are diminishing the person's accomplishments. 
UVM's own [Dean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_(education))[^1] [KC Williams](https://www.uvm.edu/cems/profiles/assistant-dean-and-director-student-services) 
[has written about](https://www.insidehighered.com/advice/2017/02/03/dealing-discrimination-black-faculty-member-essay) the 
deleterious effects of this lack of respect in academia on her, as a 
Black woman:[^2]

> Some students will refuse to address you respectfully, but they will do so with a smile. They may even attempt to call you by your first name after you have introduced yourself to them professionally with the expected “Dr.” or “Professor” preceding your last name -- on the first day of class, writing it on the board and in the syllabus.


## How you should address me
If you are a graduate student, or we have connected in a research capacity 
(e.g., have met at a conference), you should feel free to address me by my 
first name (Emma). If we have never met before and you are a student (esp. 
if you are a student reaching out about a class), you should refer to me 
as Prof. Tosch in your first email. If we have never met, and you are 
reaching out outside a university/education context, I am Dr. Tosch in your
first email. 

## When to use Mrs.
In a professional setting? Never. Just don't.
