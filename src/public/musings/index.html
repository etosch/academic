            <h1>Musings</h1>
            <p>This blog contains all of my writing that is <em>not</em> about research. </p>
<p>During graduate school I had the privilege of a thoughtful, socially-conscious, 
and engaged group of friends and colleagues with whom I could talk about both 
research and the socio-ethical issues we all faced. The pressures of faculty
life — especially under the conditions of Covid-19 — mean that I 
lost this part of my life upon starting my faculty position. </p>
<p>This blog is something of a substitute for that community and those conversations. 
It is meant to be casual and conversational. I write from experience and observation 
only — I will almost certainly have no expertise in any of the topics I discuss
and know I really ought to read more background from people who think deeply about things. 
I welcome pointers to readings in the comments. </p>
<p>I view this blog as a kind of theraputic progression of what I'm thinking about regarding
various topics over time. My opinions and interpretations almost certainly will change
with time. There will almost certainly be bad and uninformed opinions in here 
somewhere. I don't expect to write about deeply contentious topics, but in the event 
that I do, I expect my policy to be that I update posts with revised thoughts and 
acknowledgement of harm.</p>

                <p>The PhD is a professional degree and like all professional degrees, it prepares students for what are fundamentally jobs in communication. While the core of the work is technical — e.g., programming/coding, writing proofs, performing empirical analyses — that work is all for naught if you cannot communicate the fundamental insights and significance of your work to others. </p>
<p>This is why one of the things I always tells new graduate students is to write every day. &nbsp;<a href="&#x2F;musings&#x2F;writing&#x2F;#continue-reading">&#9735;Continue Reading</a>

<p>People who know me know that I am a huge proponent of treating academia 
as <em>work</em>. However, we do not work in a system that is particularly 
compatible with a modern notion of labor. The following advice attempts to 
balance how things should work (i.e., compensating people on 
the basis of their labor) with how they actually work (i.e., the reliance 
on unpaid work that is high value but not valued highly).&nbsp;<a href="&#x2F;musings&#x2F;service&#x2F;#continue-reading">&#9735;Continue Reading</a>
