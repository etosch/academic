  <p><i>October 2020</i></p>

	<p>Black lives matter.</p>

  <p>As a (white) tenure-track academic, I am in a position of power. I am new to UVM and new to the kind of structural power that one is endowed with as a professor. While this is new and exciting for me personally, it comes at a time when students are under an unusual amount of stress. It comes at a time when marginalized students, and especially Black students, are constantly being reminded of how badly they have been treated, and will be treated, by those with power. </p>

  <p>I cannot promise that I won't be selfish or callous or do harm. A byproduct of living in a system built on white supremacy is that even when we have the best intentions, it is too easy to pull those levers. The real question then becomes: how do we build trust in light of this reality? I suspect that students would benefit from two things: (1) validation of their experiences and (2) some justice, in recognition of the harm done. </p>

  <p>For validation, I expect (and would hope!) that students already have built, or in the process of building social networks of peers to support them. However, students cannot do this alone, and validation should also come from those of us with power. Many of the efforts folks have highlighted over Summer 2020 have aimed to build compassion for lived experiences, through reading and hearing testimonials. The hope is that, through this kind of engagement, we faculty will be in a better position to <i>actually hear</i> when our students express their pain, and to recognize when it is pain that we have inflicted.</p>
	
  <p>However, validation on the part of faculty is not enough, and this is where an actionable committment to redress comes into play. I pledge to do two things: (1) work to change the structural inequities in undergraduate and gradaute student education, and in the broader research community, and (2) establish low-stress mechanisms for students to be heard, along with <i>actionable consequences for my actions</i>. In a just world three things would happen in the face of harm:
	  <ol>
		  <li>People in power would <i>feel shame</i> and show it when they (either knowingly or unknowningly) abuse their power,</li>
		  <li>There would be consequences for wrongs, especially those that are more egregious, and</li>
		  <li>The person in power would take steps to ensure that that harm is not repeated.</li>
			  
	</ol>
		  </p>
<p>For now, I am still brainstorming various mechanisms that I can put in place to adequately address each of these points. If you have ideas and would like to chat, I will be hosting a weekly coffee hour:

  <p>While the above is specifically about anti-Black faculty-student interactions, the solution is equally applicable to any interaction based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyriarchy">kyriarchy</a>. To all students who feel marginalized: I hope you will find solidarity with each other and work together to advocate for yourselves, and hold us to a higher standard. My goal is to someday mold higher education into the kind of environment where all students can just be.</p>
