  <p><i>December 2020</i></p>

  <p><i>Black lives matter.</i></p>
 
  <p>The objective of this statement is to sketch how I anticipate I will address racial 
    injustices in higher education and to outline my anticipated shortcomings. 
  </p>

  <h2 name="#actions">Actions I am Taking</h2>
  <h3>In the classroom</h3>
  <p>
    The primary audience for this section is <i>undergraduate students</i>.    
  </p>
  <p>
  <ul>
    <li><b><a href="https://jeffreymoro.com/blog/2020-02-13-against-cop-shit/">No cop shit in the classroom.</a></b>
      I pledge to teach my classes from the perspective that everyone wants to learn and use their 
      time in my courses to do something they find fulfilling. I do not want students competing with each other, nor
      do I want them policing each other. I will minimize proctored, timed exams.
    </li>
    <li>
      I pledge to be <b>transparent</b> in my decision-making. Students should always feel free 
      to ask why a policy is the way it is. You may not like the answer, but I believe you are 
      <i>always</i> entitled to one! 
    </li>
    <li>
      I pledge to provide a <b>variety of paths</b> to mastery of the course material. 
    </li>
    <li>
      I will <b>always follow up</b> with students who are struggling.
    </li>
    <li>
      I will not tolerate exclusionary behavior in the classroom, nor will I tolerate hyper-competitive 
      or aggressive behavior in the classroom. I will point out such behavior <i>kindly</i>, but <i>firmly</i>, 
      and will ask such students to remove themselves from environment.       
    </li>
    <li>
      I pledge to <i>kindly</i> discourage highly participatory students from dominating classroom
      discussion (a form of entitlement), while <i>gently</i> encouraging those who participate 
      less to speak when they feel the desire to do so. 
    </li>
    <li>
      I pledge to strive for <b>non-judgement</b> in all other interactions with students.
    </li>
    <li>While disability affects all communitites, accomodations are not equally afforded. 
      I pledge to work, in consultation with <a href="https://www.uvm.edu/cems/cems-teach">CEMS TEACH</a>
    </a> on using <a href="http://universaldesign.ie/What-is-Universal-Design/">universal design</a>
  in my courses.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<h3>In research</h3>
<p>
  The primary audience for this section is <i>graduate students</i>.    
</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>I will actively recruit graduate students from outside the usual pipelines and networks. 
      <i><a href="https://cs.gmu.edu/~johnsonb/">Prof. Brittany Johnson-Matthews</a> and I 
        organized <a href="https://phd-recruiting.com">a PhD recruiting event</a> in Nov. 2020 as 
        a step in this direction.</i></li>
    <li>I pledge to report on the percentage of my research funding that comes from private companies/big tech.</li>
    <li>If a company I receive funding from <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/prominent-ai-ethics-researcher-says-google-fired-her/">behaves unethically</a>, I promise to publicly condemn their behavior (while also acknowledging that I receive funding from them).</li>
    <li>If a student does not wish to be funded via certain sources due to ethical reasons, I will work with the student to find a funding source that is acceptable to them.</li>
    <li>I expect <b>all</b> advisees to engage in service, <i>especially those with greater privilege</i>. Please see my <a href="http://advice.emmatosch.com/2020/12/14/service.html">longer statement</a> on service from my advising blog.</li>
    <li>I will always share opportunitites will all advisees; I will not make decisions about what opportunitites are "appropriate" for students.</li>
    <li>I will encourage students to connect with relevant affinity groups (e.g. <a href="https://blackinai2020.vercel.app">Black in AI</a>, <a href="https://www.sacnas.org">SACNAS</a>, etc.).</li> 
    <li>I strongly encourage research advisees to come to me if the research environment is hostile, toxic, or uncomfortable. Please see my <a href="">longer blog post</a> on this topic.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h2>Possible Shortcomings</h2>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>I may sometimes come across as short with you, or dismissive. <i>This will almost certainly
      not be because of something you've said or done</i>. Rather, it 
      will almost always be about me having too much to do, or too much on my mind in the moment.
      I am working on being more mindful about this.
    </li>
    <li>As a new professor, there will be limitations to my ability to affect change, especially
      in the short-term. I pledge to communicate those limitations, identify what actions need to be
      taken to work around them, and explain why I might not be able to follow through on them. 
    </li>
    <li>
      I am a person with baggage, flaws, and my own traumas that inform my reactions and worldview 
      in ways I am not always aware of. 
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
<p>
  I have been inspired
  by colleagues who work primarily with undergraduates: Profs. <a href="https://jjfoley.me">John Foley</a>
  and <a href="https://www.bowdoin.edu/profiles/faculty/cfreire/index.html">Cibele Matos Freire</a>.
  Additional thanks to <a href="https://cs.gmu.edu/~johnsonb/">Prof. Brittany Johnson-Matthews</a>, 
  whose compilation of resources was very helpful for organizing my thoughts, especially 
  <a href="https://blackincomputing.org">this open letter</a> and associated
   <a href="https://blackincomputing.org/action-item-list/">action item list</a>. Finally, thanks to 
   Michael Ellison,
  whose radical re-envisioning of education (currently manifested in <a href="https://codepath.org">CodePath</a>)
  I've been stewing on for over a decade. Most of what I 
  believe can be traced back to conversations we had many years ago. See my recent 
  faculty application materials for a more narrative discussion of my 
  <a href="https://blog.emmatosch.com/teaching.pdf">teaching philosophy</a> and <a href="https://blog.emmatosch.com/diversity.pdf">diversity, equity, and inclusion</a> positions.
