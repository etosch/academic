Tosch is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science in the College of Engineering and Mathematical Sciences at the University of Vermont. She works in applied programming languages (PL) research, where she treats the process of language formalization — especially the design of domain-specific languages — as a methodological approach to problems not ordinarily considered the domain of PL.

This post \nis a first pass on what that means to me.\n\nNote that some undergraduates will be assigned to me as your curriculum or major advisor. That is a very different kind of advising relationship from the one described here, and is not covered below.\nThe Advisor-Advisee Relationship\nI expect my advisees to come from a diversity of backgrounds and life experiences. Some of you may never\nhave worked in a professional setting before. Some of you may have years of experience in industry or \ngovernment. Some of you may never have had any kind of relationship with an adult who wasn't a teacher\nor a parent. Some of you may have managed teams, courted clients, or negotiated contracts. \nNo matter your background, there really is no professional relationship quite like the PhD advisor-advisee\nrelationship. Everyone starts with holes and has something to learn. The best analogy I've seen is that \nit is an apprenticeship. Apprenticeships have typically been common in the trades. I believe the analogy \nis helpful when thinking about the PhD as traditional labor, in the sense of production. It's deficient \nwhen we think of the PhD as knowledge work, and as mentorship. One way I have come to think about this \ntension is that advising is about guiding and managing production, and mentorship is about guiding \nand managing intrisic/personal growth.\nNote that while we often talk about your advisor also being a mentor, that is, in practice, often not\nthe case, and I am not sure it is actually desirable for it to be! Sometimes the directives of an advisor\nconflict with the directives of a mentor, and asking one person to be both can cause distress and \npotentially a loss of trust for the advisee. Therefore, it can be helpful for the advisee to ask \nthemselves: am I interacting with my PhD advisor as a supervison, or as a mentor?\nAdvisors as Managers: Time\nGenerally speaking, most students are funded to work 20 hours per week for the term of their contract, \neither as a TA (teaching assistant) or an RA (research assistant). \nRegardless of how you spend your time, it is important to discuss up front with your work supervisor\n(i.e., the instructor of the course if you are a TA, or your research supervision if you are an RA)\nhow that time should be allocated, and what the contractual obligations are. For example, are you \nexpected to work up to 20 hours per week, an average of 20 hours per week, or a total of the \nnumber of weeks in your contract, times 20 hours per week? Are there major deadlines around which you \nshould not travel? Are there deliverables or meetings you are expected to attend?\nIn my experience, most supervisors don't speak explicitly about hours, but rather set expectations that \nmost closely comport with the third interpretation (i.e., as if you have a total number hours expected).\nThis can mean that there are times when there is little work and times when you are expected to engage \nin \"sprints,\" where your week hours will exceed 20 hours per week.\nI strongly encourage students to discuss expectations with their supervisor ahead of time. I personally\nplan to do this with my students. I strongly prefer consistency in hours for a variety of reasons (e.g., \nit's easier for students with health issues or familial responsibilities to plan around them, I don't think \nsprints are mentally or physically healthy, etc.), but this tends to require more planning up front (i.e., \nacting rather than re-acting) and can puts more burden on the supervisor. Supervisors tend to have a lot \nof responsibilities and wear many hats, so staying organized and on top of things can be challenging. \nThis is especially true of new professors; I will do my best to prioritize my students over other \nresponsibilties, but know that this can be challenging to actually pull off! The important thing for \nstudents to remember is that you should feel empowered to have these conversations early and often!\nFinally, note that assistantships \nbenefit the advisee both financially (i.e., you are paid) and educationally (i.e., they are training you \nto teach/do curriculum development, or they are training you how to do research).\nAdvisors as Mentors: RAships\nIn the general case, you should not be spending, on average, more than the time you are paid on your\nassistantship. The major exception to this is when you have an RAship that overlaps with your \ndissertation topic (or, for very junior studnets, research area you think might provide the foundation\nof your dissertation). Advisors tend to encourage students to find an overlapping RAship because it's good \nfor the student (making progress on the project is equivalent to making progress on your degree, and \nremoves the overhead of context-switching) and because it's good for the advisor (you have incentives\nto go above and beyond the outlined work because you now have a personal stake in it). \nIn the ideal world, an RAship would work something like this: you start graduate school funded on your\nadvisor's project, or on a more senior student's project. \nYou put in your 20 hours, and over the course of your first year, you are largely \nworking on someone else's project, learning how to do research. Ideally, you'd work with your advisor\nto set learning goals and output goals. Then, once you find your feet, you work with your advisor\nto find funding for the research you want to do. \nHowever, there are many ways that this process can go awry. In particular, since it relies on your\ngrowth as a researcher, advising here can become intertwined with mentorship. \nFor example, you may never find a research area or question that motivates you. Sometimes students\ndiscover that they don't actually like research. Sometimes students discover they don't like the\nworking style of their advisor. There are many things that can make the working relationship rocky. \nA common failure mode is that the student discovers that the topics that really interest them, or the questions \nthat really motivate them, are outside the scope of what their advisor cares about, or has expertise in.\nPart of developing an independent research identity is learning how to pitch your research idea to your\nsupervisor. However, it is not the obligation of a supervisor to invest in a new research area because \ntheir student has interest there. Just as it is important for students to recognize that they are entitled to \nboundaries from their research supervisor, it is important for studnets to recognize that their supervisors\nare entitled to boundaries from their student's research interests. This is why many schools advertise to \nprospective graduate students that it is easy to change advisors. \nYour advisor is a coach, not a parent\nEach advisor's and advisee's needs will be different, so it is critically important to continually \ncommunicate needs and expectations. It can be quite challenging for students when they need one \nthing from a supervisor and another thing from a mentor. \nThis is issue is particular pronounced when students struggle. Consider the following scenario: a\nstudent is having personal struggles that are affecting their work performance on a funded project that \nhas a deadlines and deliverables. The advisor then must step in to complete the work. The student needs\ncompassion and encouragement, but they have also put other students' funding in jeopardy because the \nadvisor had to use time that was allocated to writing grants on delivering on this grant. In this particular\n(not terribly uncommon) case, the advisor may feel conflicted between their roles as work supervisor \nand mentor. \nIt can be tempting for students to think of their advisors as parental surrogates -- after all, \nthe heirarchical and often patriarchal nature of academia makes it all too easy for everyone to buy into\nthis model of mentorship. I prefer to think of advisors as coaches: we want our team to do their best\n(and preferably win!), but most of all, we\nwant to support each team member in their professional and personal goal. Good teams are more than the sum \nof their parts, and good coaches know when to deliver tough truths and when to step out of the way. \nGood coaches also understand that getting a good game out of the team isn't about the coach. Finally, \ngood coaches understand that athletes sometimes need personal coaches and trainers, and aren't threatened \nby that. \nAre you my advisor?\nFinally, I want to make it explicit what I mean when I consider someone to be my advisee. I consider an advisee to be \nsomeone whose degree progress I am directly and strictly greater than 50% responsible for, or someone \nwhose research I directly or indirectly supervise. \nThis means that if I am on a committee that determines your fate (e.g., thesis committee or curriculum committee),\nI am not necessarily your advisor. If I agree supervise your thesis, but you never follow up, I am not \nnecessarily your advisor. If we talk about research, but either party never follows up, I am not your advisor. \nIf you aren't sure, just ask!\nAcknowledgements\nThis post is the result of culmination of many years of thinking about the power differential between adivsor\nand advisee, but most recently I owe the distinction between advising and mentoring to discussions with \nSara Kingsley.\n","id":"/musings/advising/","title":"Advising Expectations Basics"},"/musings/drafts/":{"body":"","id":"/musings/drafts/","title":""},"/musings/drafts/adhd-2/":{"body":"Right now ADHD appears to be having something of a moment.

Here is that diagnosis story:\nTale 1: Getting diagnosed\nI won't go into the details of my childhood right now, but by the time I was in college I had been struggling with depression and anxiety for some time — or so I thought. I'd go to therapy, where I'd be told things like, \"you're good at therapy,\" or where we wouldn't really discuss my problems or things that brought me there. I'd occassionally be prescribed SSRIs for the depression and anxiety and benzodiazapems for panic attacks. I found that SSRIs made me depressed, but my doctors didn't believe me. I hated benzos, and became suspicious of the dosage when I became twitchy after taking them as prescribed. The only drugs I took voluntarily were my trusty Camel lights and bourban or beer (depending on the time of year).\nMy senior year in college, I was having a rough time with SSRIs again and was trying to go off them. I was sure they'd fucked with my brain. I was having a hard time staying awake, and had debilitating anxiety about leaving my room. Twice that year I'd gotten black out drunk, one time waking up in my own vomit, and the next time coming to in the toilet stall of student health services. The previous year when I was experiencing this anxiety, I'd hidden in my room for several days and even went so far as to pee in a cup and pour it out my window, I was so afraid of running into people upon leaving. \nAnyway, my school-issued therapist sent me to the school psychiatrist during finals, where I told him what was going on. He prescribed me two meds to get me through the end of the semester: benzos (big surprise) and amphetamine.\nNow, I had never taken amphetamine before. I knew other students who had prescriptions and they were hot messes (which is probably why we were friends? I could never maintain friendships with \"serious people\"). I also knew that there was a market for amphetamine and it seemed to flow to rich kids who partied on it or used it to cram.1 I had also read On the Road in high school during my lunch breaks when I worked at Wawa and very much feared this drug as a result. \nSo I went and I filled the two prescriptions. During a prior meeting with a therapist or shrink — the details are fuzzy now — I'd been told that I didn't need to take the benzos consistently, that my prior doctor was not correct in that. Instead, I was told to consider them a safety net, and that sometimes just knowing that you have them can help. \nI ended up talking to a mentor about the amphetamines and disclosed that part of the reason I was afraid of them was because I was afraid I would like them and become addicted.

He told me I didn't have to take them if I didn't want to, but I was likely prescriped a theraputic dosage and if I wanted to see if they helped, I should not be afraid of becoming addicted, but also that I had a safety net if I felt out of control. \nNow at this point I should note that I had had many toxic friendships and suspect that I sought out \"broken people.\" I desperately wanted to like  Just as ADHD seems to be having \"a moment\" now, in the first decade of the 20th century, borderline prsonality disorder was having its moment.

A lot of what I've been experiencing recently is either directly or indirectly due to the pandemic (and, according to my therapist, the patriarchy!). I currently have a blog post three months in the making about what it's been like to start a TT job during the pandemic. However, what I'm feeling most acutely right now is the daily dread of teaching. \nTeaching as social work\nI have always been too much of an empathetic person. When I was a child, my father told me not to become a social worker because the job would destroy me. I don't remember what caused him to say this specifically, but he was right — I struggle to detach emotionally from social situations and manage feelings of powerlessness when fighting a beurocracy on behalf of others. One of the challenages when teaching is that it is fundamentally a mixture of pedagogy, curation, and social work. \nFirst experience at the front of the classroom\nI'd had the experience of a guest lecturing a few classes I was TAing while at Brandeis, where the class sizes ranged from 20-30 students. At the time, I thought that situation was pretty great. I'd had a soul-crushing industrial job at a small company prior to going back to school, and it was fun to teach because teaching was a way to learn and I loved sharing in that process. This was all at the end of the last recession. I remember some of the professors being quite depressed and it impacting their teaching. It was demoralizing as student. However, although I was struggling (especially financially), I was in a different place from the professors and enjoyed what I did. The students were fantastic — engaging, kind, and fun. Since I was not responsible for the class, all curation was over discretionary content. Since the students were generally in very good headspaces, there was very little social work. As a result, I had the privilege of being able to focus on the pedagogy. \nFirst experience as instructor of record\nConversely, as a graduate student, I co-taught a large (180-student) required class. I had very mixed feelings about that experience, namely due to how dehumanizing to everyone such large classes are. Because the course was required and because there were existing materials, I had very little curation I needed to do. However, because the class was very large, the number of students who were struggling was much higher. \nDuring pre-pandemic times, I'd say that you can expect about 10% of your class to be struggling at any point in time. In a class of 20-30, this is only 2-3 students. In a class of 180, this is an entire class size by itself. As a TA, I'd prided myself on identifying students who were struggling very early and setting aside time to meet with them. However, as classes grew in size, I ran into the typical problem of not being able to serve everyone and in my attempts to do so, serving no one. Additionally, I found the attitudes of professors who advised me on teaching disheartening. I was told many times over that \"the students are not like you\" and to spend less time on teaching. I found the former especially disturbing because these professors often never had me as a student — and certainly never as an undergradaute — and I could feel the mismatch in experiences, values, and worldview. I did not find the latter helpful, since what took the most time was engaging with students, and disengaging felt like the abnegation of a moral obligation. \nAdditionally, this time I was (and again, situationally) depressed. The year prior, my then-advisor ended the adivising relationship1 and I was still dealing with the fallout of that. Things were starting to get better, but I accepted the teaching position for two reasons: (1) it paid more than being a TA, and I'd only been funded half-time the previous summer and (2) I was grateful that someone thought I was sufficiently capable of teaching that they requested me for my expertise.2 \nIn any case, I found that, in a lot of ways, the students actually were like me when I was an undergraduate: they were frustrated and angry at the system and knew something was wrong, but didn't know how to articulate it. The natural impulse is to find the first responsible person and ascribe the faults in the system to them. It was well-known that required courses were the toughest to teach and I was warned ahead of time that if students did poorly, they would blame any differences from the prior semester on those differences — and having a graduate student, rather than a professor at the the head of the classroom was one such obvious difference. \nI knew all this going in. However, what I didn't realize was terrible it felt to feel like you're constantly fucking up (even if you objectively are not) and having what felt like everyone screaming at both (sometimes) your acutal fuckups, as well as things that are completely outside of your control. I could own my mistakes, but I was also distressed over the things that upset the students that I could not change. \nAdditionally, I was struggling with depression and very concerned that it was leaking to the students. I remembered how challenging it was as a student who was paying a large sum of money for a course to feel like my professor wasn't taking the course seriously. I remember feeling like they were wasting my time and money. What I didn't know at the time was how much universities run on the margins: univerisites are landlords first and centers of learning second. Tuition doesn't fund professors' salaries so much as it keeps the lights on in the classrooms. \nIn any case, I am pretty sure we managed to handle all of those concerns, but it didn't stop the general feeling I'd had of participating in a system that is fundamentally exploitative and terrible. \nHaving the power to do things differently\nWhen I started this job, one thing I wanted to do differently was to teach in a way that corrected the paternalistic lecture model — one where students could learn according to their own pace and discretion, where evaluation was informative, rather than punative. Doing so while originating a course is very challenging and requires being in the right headspace. All three courses I've taught so far I've had to originate materials for. Regardless of the specifics of my circumstances, \nI think one of the worst things about teaching while depressed is that the people who are not unhappy (and they are often people who seem to be never unhappy) don't \"get it,\" while the people who are unhappy are not in a place \nThere's no group therapy for depressed professors. \n1\nI sometimes phrase this as his having fired me, but technically he did not fire me — had that happened, I'd've had the opportunity to file a grievance through my union. It was then that I first came to understand how little unions matter when faced with a determined employer. \n\n2\nThis is definitely worth a separate blog post, so I will be brief here: I am both extremely motivated by and suspicious of praise. Many of my formative experiences in education were punative and as a result I can be very cagey around educators. Throughout my whole life I'd found that educators and people above me in the org chart have very bimodal views of me: they either think I'm great or think I'm someone who needs to be put in her place. Due to the latter, I tend to be rather attached to and loyal to the former in ways that often put me in a vulnerable position, especially when the person delivering the praise is a man with power over me. \n\n","id":"/musings/drafts/teaching-depressed/","title":"The terrible pain of teaching under situational depression"},"/musings/drafts/walking-away/":{"body":"On the power of walking away\nAfter three semester on the tenure track, I've decided to leaave my position at UVM. I've made this choice for myriad reasons, ranging from those specific to the institution, to my feeling about the state of higher education right now. While I've experienced a range of intense emotions regarding this choice, I'm in the acceptance phase right now and wanted to reflect on that.\nWalking away right now\nWhen I accepted my offer from UVM in February 2020, there was chatter about Covid, but having seen the hype and subsequent lack of pandemic in the US regarding SARS, Bird Flu, and Swine Flu, I didn't think anything of the situation until \"Safer at Home\" began and the stock market shut down. Then the person who recruited me to UVM left. This was a huge blow — one of the top reasons I wanted to go to UVM was because he was here. I had had a rough time during my PhD and my colleague had endured similar challenges. Furthermore, the things I'd experienced as a PhD student drove me away from my home research area (PL/SE) and I was excited to join a growing group of researchers and return to my old community. \nUnfortunately, the world has changed since then. As many have noted, things are not going well for students right now, so there is considerably more emotional labor and social work that faculty are expected to do. It's hard to teach when you feel like you are constantly failing your students. Furthermore, having moved to a new state, I left behind my social safety net and found it nearly impossible to build a new one. Some of this is due to Covid and will feel universal — it's nearly impossible to feel anything but drained when meeting new people virtually. Some of this is due to the culture in Chittenden county — I've come to realize that Vermont and Burlington in particular is a place that people go to to get away from others. \nAs things opened up again, people were more social, but I've observed their efforts were focused on their existing social ties. My whole life, I've met fascinating people in passing: on the bus, at the store, at the gym, while taking a cigarette break (back when I smoked). Here however, while I've exchanged pleasantries with folks  Thus, despite making efforts to form new relationships, I feel impossibly alone here. Yes, I live with my partner, but domestic partners are not a community. \nLiving in Vermont was our dream. It was my dream. We used to come to Burlington for our \"staycations\" (it was our Muncie) and starting several years before I went on the job market, I would joke about getting a faculty job UVM and how awesome that would be. \nUnfortunately, reality has turned out to be different. Therefore, John and I have decided that we need to leave Vermont. We need to be closer to our friends and family and people who share our outlook on life and our values. \nWithout my colleague, I had no advocate here.\nWe are not all living in the same society. \n","id":"/musings/drafts/walking-away/","title":""},"/musings/service/":{"body":"Reposted from an older blog.\nPeople who know me know that I am a huge proponent of treating academia \nas work. However, we do not work in a system that is particularly \ncompatible with a modern notion of labor. The following advice attempts to \nbalance how things should work (i.e., compensating people on \nthe basis of their labor) with how they actually work (i.e., the reliance \non unpaid work that is high value but not valued highly).\nWe can typically break service obligations into three categories: lab, department/college/university (internal) and external. I will discuss lab service last, since it can be the trickiest to manage.\nInternal service\nI typically encourage graduate students in their first two years to do only internal service. What is internal service? It's service work within your department/college. The benefits of doing internal service and prioritizing internal service are:\n\nIt gives students a chance to meet other students and build a support network.\nIt builds camaraderie between students who serve.\nIt (usually) gives students a chance to meet faculty who are neither their advisors nor their professors, whom they may want to ask for letters later on.\nIt can empower students to feel like they have control over their academic and immediate social environments. \nIt can be a \"trial run\" for external service. \n\nThe major theme here is using internal service as a structured way to get to learn more about a department and its norms. There are many kinds of internal service. As an example, my PhD program had the following opportunities:\n\nOrganizers of Monday Morning Coffee and Thursday Tea. These were primarily low-effort weekly social events. If you were a shy person, it was a great way to break the ice with people. \nGraduate Union Representative. This was my primary service over the years: our graduate students were unionized and serving made it easier for me to be in the loop for contract negotiations. \nSeminar organizers and volunteers. There were a variety of seminar series for different CS sub-disciplines when I was in graduate school. These seminars ranged from being entirely student-run (e.g., the Machine Learning and Friends Lunch) to entirely faculty-run (e.g., the Systems Lunch). Typically student organizers and volunteers had the chance to select and then later meet speakers. While these positions were certainly work, they were considered very desirable, due to the networking opportunities they afforded.\nGraduate representative to the faculty. This was a must-do service activity for any graduate student interested in faculty jobs. GradReps attended faculty meetings, interviewed faculty candidates, and were allowed to vote on non-RPT (reappointment, promotion, and tenure) matters. This is one of the best ways to see how the sausage of academia gets made. \n\nInternal service should immediately benefit you, the student. If you are, for example, volunteering at a seminar, but you are just doing setup and cleanup and have no special opportunitites to meet the speakers, you may want to consider putting your efforts elsewhere.\nExternal Service\nI typically recommend that students wait until they feel more secure in their position before doing external service. This might mean having published their first research paper, having reached PhD candidacy, or having completed their coursework. The reason is that stakes tend to feel higher for external service, and the load also tends to be higher. It is not uncommon to feel overwhelmed in the first year or so of graduate school, so I am a huge fan of minimizing obligations and focusing on two things in the early years: (1) building your internal PhD support network and (2) growing your expertise in your subfield. \nAt some point, every student will start to feel more confident, and that is a very good point to begin doing external service. This may happen earlier for some folks than others. Some external service obligations are more intense than others, but all external service is important for building your reputation in your resaerch community. I recommend starting to incorporate external service in the following order:\n\nStudent volunteering at conferences. Some students will begin doing this quite early. I think it can be beneficial early on to get a sense of what different research communities are like and what they work on. However, once you are sure of your research area, it is not worth being a student volunteer until you are at a point where you intend to attend conferences regularly. Once you do start attending conferences, being a student volunteer can be an easy way to meet other students. You will eventually \"grow out\" of this, though. I don't recommend being a student volunteer more than three times in your field; after that, people should start asking you to do more intensive external service. \nStudent reviewing. Different subfields have different approaches to student reviewing. In SIGPLAN conferences, students who have not published at a conference are typically introduced to reviewing via Artifact Evaluation. In ML/AI venues, where the number of submissions is very high, many conferences have started asking for students to self-nominate as reviewers. I do not recommend reviewing papers for conferences until the latter half of your PhD. \nConference/Workshop Organization. There are some annual workshops or small co-located conferences that involve student organizers, where being asked to chair that workshop or conference is considered a great honor. There are other circumstances where, e.g., you and your advisor may prepare a written proposal that you must submit for review. This kind of service is very labor-intensive and I only recommend it in the last two years of your PhD. \n\nLab service\nLab service is necessarily low-impact and can involve anything from taking notes during lab meetings, to maintaining the lab website, to mentoring junior students. Lab service can be highly beneficial to students for building camaraderie and trust. However, poorly distributed lab service can completely undermine mutual trust and respect. \nOne of the unfortunate truths of graduate school is that certain work just needs to get done, and it is simply easier for faculty to lean on \"reliable\" students they know will follow through. In a fair world, faculty would keep track of the balance between opportunitity and service and ensure that all students do their fair share, while no students are unduly burdened. Unfortunately, this is not common practice. In light of that, students must learn to advocate for themselves. This can be quite tricky, since students and faculty each have incomplete pictures of the situation. \nExploitation\nIt will always be necessary for students to stand up for themselves. The key is doing so politically. While exploitation can happen in any context, in my experience it is most egregious and difficult to manage when the parties involved know each other well: trust and familiarity are often preconditions.\nThat said, one person's exploitation is another person's opportunity -- only you can know if the situation is bad for you. \nNo matter who are you, when asked to do unpaid work, continually ask yourself: what am I getting out of this? Consider the above example, where you are doing setup and cleanup for a seminar series. If you enjoy doing this work as a break from you day, then no one should make you feel bad for not \"getting more out of it!\" Everyone finds satisfaction in different activities and it is perfectly legitimate to spend time on activities that don't translate to an impressive line on a c.v. or networking opportuntities if you find them fulfilling. \nRemember: someone who exploits your labor now, or fails to see your contributions now, is not going to write you a strong recommendation later. \nQuitting unpaid work\nQuitting service can be politically tricky. Often the folks you report to are fulfilling service obligations themselves and can fail to advocate for themselves. In such circumstances, it's probably best to not come out and say: I feel exploited. It's better to simply say: this position is no longer working for me, and I need to scale back or quit. \nIf the service obligation has no fixed end date, then you should be able to quit whenever. Term-based service obligation is usually for a fixed length of time, and you should generally try to complete your term before quitting. If you cannot, be firm in your end date. Even if the person you report to is overworked and exploited themselves, they should not be operating in an environment where the margins are so thin that one person quitting prematurely ruins everything. \nFinally, remember that in academic computer science, no one's livelihood is on the line if we have to quit a service obligation. If it were really that important, we'd be paid!\n","id":"/musings/service/","title":"Regarding Graduate Student Service"},"/musings/writing/":{"body":"The PhD is a professional degree and like all professional degrees, it prepares students for what are fundamentally jobs in communication. While the core of the work is technical — e.g., programming/coding, writing proofs, performing empirical analyses — that work is all for naught if you cannot communicate the fundamental insights and significance of your work to others. \nThis is why one of the things I always tells new graduate students is to write every day.   Many new graduate students struggle under the lack of structure, inherent uncertainty, and deep questions about motivation in their pursuit of the PhD, so I believe these skills and coping strategies can be useful for most students. \nThere are many kinds of written communication that we should all practice every day. I still have a \"write for an hour every day\" in my daily to-do lists! A timer is ticking as I write this post right now! Below I detail recommendations for various forms of writing; you should eventually consider rotating through each of them as part of your routine:\n\nJournaling\nBlogging\nTech Reports/Memos\nSocial Media\n\nI don't typically mean journaling, but that could be the right starting point for you\nFirst I'd like to get a misconception out of the way: the kind of writing you do matters, but there is no one-size-fits all advice on how you should allocate your time. I've had some students think that writing every day means journaling. \nThere are only 24 hours in a day, so think of the type of writing you choose to do in terms of the opportunity cost of not doing some other type of writing.\nExample. My undergraduate degree required a great deal of writing and I was developing a strict discipline of time-boxing via the pomodoro technique as part of a larger mindfulness practice at the start of my PhD. Thus when I started my daily writing practice, I did not need to journal, since I was more or less doing this already. Instead, I needed to focus on writing down and synthesizing my thoughts on the things I'd read, concepts I'd struggled with, and generally become more fluent in the language of scientific communication, as it was practiced in my research field. \nMy general advice is: if you already journal, or if journaling is already comfortable to do you, prioritize other writing tasks. If you struggle to get started writing at all, then by all means, journal!\nLow-stakes writing: blog posts\nI love blogging: I love doing it, I love the concept of it. What I love about it is that it is absolutely low-stakes: posts should be short (my typical length is probably 2-3 times too long!).  They should be clear and accessible. You can freely admit to not knowing things. You can try out arguments and say things that are wrong. You can take the time and space you need to really explore an idea, and you can punt on the things you don't have time to write about or think about deeply. \nStudents often feel vulnerable when they first approach blogging. I usually assure them that no one is reading their blog posts! What I am really doing when I say this is making a \"security by obscurity\" argument. Of course someone will read your blog posts eventually, but given the sheer quantity of content on the internet, no one is reading them that deeply and no one has the bandwidth, nor inclination to judge you. \nI'd also note that my most popular blog post has nothing to do with my research; it is a post with instructions on how to incorporate custom javascript in Jekyll blogs. It gets the most hits, has the most comments, and I have occassionally been tweeted at for it. One of the things I love about this is that I wrote something other people found useful, which isn't always the case with research! ;) In any case, this is all kind of cool, but goes to show that you cannot control what people will respond to. \nSo...if no one really reads your posts, what is the point? Here are what I consider the true benefits of blog posts:\nBlogging provides a way to get \"partial credit.\" Editing involves two distinct tasks: re-writing prose and removing content. \n\nRe-writing prose. It can take time to find the right pitch for your abstract and introduction. With each re-submission, the world changes a little and so it stands to reason that the way we talk about timely problems changes a little. Sometimes we become better at explaining certain concepts. Blog posts can help students (and faculty and research scientists — anyone, really!) hash out the clearest prose for a particular audience. \nRemoving content. Most venues have a page limit. The page limit ought to map to a contribution of a particular size and there ought to be thematic cohesion in the document submitted. This means that sometimes technical content gets cut. There are sometimes strategic reasons for this (e.g., some advisors advocate reducing \"surface attack area\"), but it's generally best to think about it as a communication challenge: you need to save sufficient space to explain your work and why it matters. Your objective should not be to cram as much technical content into a draft as possible. It can be hard to murder your babies, but with blogging you don't have to!\n\nPotential employers/collaborators/etc. know what you are working on. Publishing work in high-quality venues takes time. Many students in my field take over a year to submit their first paper. This is a problem when applying for internships, fellowships, etc., because it means you have no outward-facing discussions of your work. It can be quite difficult for new researchers to find venues where they can advertise and speak about their work, especially for those who started in the pandemic. Blogging is one way to make that information public. \nWriting papers gets easier. Many students struggle to write their first paper. Scientific writing uses specialized language and different communities expect papers to have different structure. In addition to the mechanics of what goes into a paper, each research community as has its own dialect. It takes time and practice to build fluency in that dialect. Just as you cannot learn a language passively, you cannot learn to write for a community passively. Lab presentations, invited talks, workshops, and more informal forms of rapid communication (e.g., talking!) are a great ways to build this fluency, which will make writing papers easier!\nBlogging as research notebook\nOne of the primary benefits of blogging your research is that it can function as prior art! Sometimes students fear being scooped. I'm not going to discuss recourse for stolen work here, but junior students should feel confident about sharing their work and establishing a record and timeline via blogging. \nHigher-stakes writing: tech memos/reports\nGood papers go through many iterations of writing, often via resubmissions. Each venue target may have a different target audience. Time matters too: tastes and attitudes about novelty and worthiness may change dramatically between submissions. \nWhat is a tech memo? A tech memo is usually longer than a blog post, and often a bit more formal. While blog posts should be fairly self-contained, tech memos need not be. A short tech memo might eventually correspond to an expanded section of a paper or an appendix. Writing the technical content of an upcoming paper submission as a tech memo can be very helpful for focusing your time and resources on the pitch closer to the deadline. Tech memos can be written as tutorials, proposals, or other forms not quite appropriate for a research paper, but helpful for explaining work done. \nWhy tech memos are useful to you and others. \n\nHow I found them useful. I wrote quite a few tech memos at the end of my PhD. They were helpful for me to work through ideas during the pandemic, when I didn't have many people to talk to. They allowed me to pull on threads that might not go anywhere and be more effective and efficient at creative thinking. \nEase into paper-writing. First papers aren't just hard because of the actual writing of sentences; it's the whole package of balancing low-level details with high-level vision, of hyping up your work while imagining how Reviewer #2 might interpret what you did, of balancing the theoretical contributions with the empirical contributions. Tech memos don't have to be all things; they can be just one (plus LaTeX practice!).\nProtect your work/contributions. Sometimes students leave academia; having a record of tech memos (whether internally or externally) can help the next student who picks up the work, while also clearly establishing you as a co-author. Lab-based tech memo repositories can help with institutional memory vis a vis prior work, preventing churn.\n\nPR-writing is the worst: social media posts \nFinally, elevator pitches for your work are incredibly important. I hate these and am very bad at them. I don't get anything out of them when other people pitch them and hate hate hate hate doing this myself. \nSomewhere (perhaps in an old Twitter account), I have a bookmarked Twitter thread about how to pitch your research on Twitter. Since I cannot find that original thread now, here is a link to an article that looks quite reasonable. \nI clearly prefer longer-form writing, which probably means I should work on my Twitter game! In any case, tweeting about work (especially in a way non-conversational way) definitely counts as writing!\nAddendum: There is no one \"right\" way to write!\nI've seen many students have anxiety about writing in graduate school. Sometimes this is because they are not native speakers and are self-conscious about their writing. Sometimes this is because their native dialect, while English, is not considered \"proper\" academic writing. I have also seen faculty handle this anxiety poorly and too often contribute to it. \nMy take is that there are two fundamental goals of writing: \n\nClearly communicate your ideas to an audience.\nSignal your membership in the in-group to that audience.\n\nMost criticism of writing is a mix of these two. I tend to deal with #1 by asking increasingly detailed questions and expressing that I am the one who is struggling to understand, but that I need their help to explain it to me. I often struggle to communicate new ideas and connections myself and try to model equal partnership in communication. \n#2 is thorny. I try to separate criticism of voice and style from community norms regarding technical content. The latter includes things the specific section titles, use of \\paragraph{&lt;Topic&gt;.} in papers, community-specific vocabulary, etc. The former is any writing that sounds like an outsider in my internal voice, but where the voice is no impediment to my comprehension. For me this includes overly pedantic requirements regarding punctuation, grammar, and diction that do not change the clarity nor meaning of the text. I could write another blog post on the merits of being explcit about the costs and benefits of adapating one's voice, but this post is too long already!\n","id":"/musings/writing/","title":"Writing every day"},"/projects/":{"body":"","id":"/projects/","title":"Projects"},"/projects/experiments/":{"body":"Background:A few years ago now, Eytan Bakshy designed a domain-specific language for online field experiments, PlanOut.
