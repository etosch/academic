She is particularly interested in building languages and tools for data scientists and social scientists and has recently been applying her work in the cybersecurity domain.\nTosch's primary interests are in PL applications to data collection and analysis. Her early work on SurveyMan — a language and framework for designing, debugging, and deploying surveys — won first place in the 2014 ACM student research competition at PLDI, a best paper award at OOPSLA 2014, and a 2015 Outstanding Synthesis Award in the College of Computer and Information Sciences at the University of Massachusetts. Her work on PlanAlyzer — a static analysis tool for programmatically-defined experiments — was recognized as a SIGPLAN research highlight in 2020 and was honored as a Research Highlight in the September 2021 issue of the Communications of the ACM. \nTosch has additionally worked in question answering (natural language processing), evolutionary computation, and explainable AI and has research interests related to causal inference. \nEmma Tosch earned her B.A in English Literature from Wellesley College in 2008 before working at a healthcare IT start up. She obtained a post-baccalaureate certificate and M.A. in Computer Science from Brandeis University in 2011 before earning her PhD from the University of Massachusetts Amherst in 2020.\n","id":"/biography/","title":"Biography"},"/demo/":{"body":"Table of contents\n\nDesktop controls\nDesktop controls with bookmarks\nFree mobile controls\nCamera path mobile\nGoogle Cardboard\n\nDescriptions\nDesktop versions\nThese versions are meant to be accessed through a computer.

This post \nis a first pass on what that means to me.\n\nNote that some undergraduates will be assigned to me as your curriculum or major advisor. That is a very different kind of advising relationship from the one described here, and is not covered below.\nThe Advisor-Advisee Relationship\nI expect my advisees to come from a diversity of backgrounds and life experiences. Some of you may never\nhave worked in a professional setting before. Some of you may have years of experience in industry or \ngovernment. Some of you may never have had any kind of relationship with an adult who wasn't a teacher\nor a parent. Some of you may have managed teams, courted clients, or negotiated contracts. \nNo matter your background, there really is no professional relationship quite like the PhD advisor-advisee\nrelationship. Everyone starts with holes and has something to learn. The best analogy I've seen is that \nit is an apprenticeship. Apprenticeships have typically been common in the trades. I believe the analogy \nis helpful when thinking about the PhD as traditional labor, in the sense of production. It's deficient \nwhen we think of the PhD as knowledge work, and as mentorship. One way I have come to think about this \ntension is that advising is about guiding and managing production, and mentorship is about guiding \nand managing intrisic/personal growth.\nNote that while we often talk about your advisor also being a mentor, that is, in practice, often not\nthe case, and I am not sure it is actually desirable for it to be! Sometimes the directives of an advisor\nconflict with the directives of a mentor, and asking one person to be both can cause distress and \npotentially a loss of trust for the advisee. Therefore, it can be helpful for the advisee to ask \nthemselves: am I interacting with my PhD advisor as a supervison, or as a mentor?\nAdvisors as Managers: Time\nGenerally speaking, most students are funded to work 20 hours per week for the term of their contract, \neither as a TA (teaching assistant) or an RA (research assistant). \nRegardless of how you spend your time, it is important to discuss up front with your work supervisor\n(i.e., the instructor of the course if you are a TA, or your research supervision if you are an RA)\nhow that time should be allocated, and what the contractual obligations are. For example, are you \nexpected to work up to 20 hours per week, an average of 20 hours per week, or a total of the \nnumber of weeks in your contract, times 20 hours per week? Are there major deadlines around which you \nshould not travel? Are there deliverables or meetings you are expected to attend?\nIn my experience, most supervisors don't speak explicitly about hours, but rather set expectations that \nmost closely comport with the third interpretation (i.e., as if you have a total number hours expected).\nThis can mean that there are times when there is little work and times when you are expected to engage \nin \"sprints,\" where your week hours will exceed 20 hours per week.\nI strongly encourage students to discuss expectations with their supervisor ahead of time. I personally\nplan to do this with my students. I strongly prefer consistency in hours for a variety of reasons (e.g., \nit's easier for students with health issues or familial responsibilities to plan around them, I don't think \nsprints are mentally or physically healthy, etc.), but this tends to require more planning up front (i.e., \nacting rather than re-acting) and can puts more burden on the supervisor. Supervisors tend to have a lot \nof responsibilities and wear many hats, so staying organized and on top of things can be challenging. \nThis is especially true of new professors; I will do my best to prioritize my students over other \nresponsibilties, but know that this can be challenging to actually pull off! The important thing for \nstudents to remember is that you should feel empowered to have these conversations early and often!\nFinally, note that assistantships \nbenefit the advisee both financially (i.e., you are paid) and educationally (i.e., they are training you \nto teach/do curriculum development, or they are training you how to do research).\nAdvisors as Mentors: RAships\nIn the general case, you should not be spending, on average, more than the time you are paid on your\nassistantship. The major exception to this is when you have an RAship that overlaps with your \ndissertation topic (or, for very junior studnets, research area you think might provide the foundation\nof your dissertation). Advisors tend to encourage students to find an overlapping RAship because it's good \nfor the student (making progress on the project is equivalent to making progress on your degree, and \nremoves the overhead of context-switching) and because it's good for the advisor (you have incentives\nto go above and beyond the outlined work because you now have a personal stake in it). \nIn the ideal world, an RAship would work something like this: you start graduate school funded on your\nadvisor's project, or on a more senior student's project. \nYou put in your 20 hours, and over the course of your first year, you are largely \nworking on someone else's project, learning how to do research. Ideally, you'd work with your advisor\nto set learning goals and output goals. Then, once you find your feet, you work with your advisor\nto find funding for the research you want to do. \nHowever, there are many ways that this process can go awry. In particular, since it relies on your\ngrowth as a researcher, advising here can become intertwined with mentorship. \nFor example, you may never find a research area or question that motivates you. Sometimes students\ndiscover that they don't actually like research. Sometimes students discover they don't like the\nworking style of their advisor. There are many things that can make the working relationship rocky. \nA common failure mode is that the student discovers that the topics that really interest them, or the questions \nthat really motivate them, are outside the scope of what their advisor cares about, or has expertise in.\nPart of developing an independent research identity is learning how to pitch your research idea to your\nsupervisor. However, it is not the obligation of a supervisor to invest in a new research area because \ntheir student has interest there. Just as it is important for students to recognize that they are entitled to \nboundaries from their research supervisor, it is important for studnets to recognize that their supervisors\nare entitled to boundaries from their student's research interests. This is why many schools advertise to \nprospective graduate students that it is easy to change advisors. \nYour advisor is a coach, not a parent\nEach advisor's and advisee's needs will be different, so it is critically important to continually \ncommunicate needs and expectations. It can be quite challenging for students when they need one \nthing from a supervisor and another thing from a mentor. \nThis is issue is particular pronounced when students struggle. Consider the following scenario: a\nstudent is having personal struggles that are affecting their work performance on a funded project that \nhas a deadlines and deliverables. The advisor then must step in to complete the work. The student needs\ncompassion and encouragement, but they have also put other students' funding in jeopardy because the \nadvisor had to use time that was allocated to writing grants on delivering on this grant. In this particular\n(not terribly uncommon) case, the advisor may feel conflicted between their roles as work supervisor \nand mentor. \nIt can be tempting for students to think of their advisors as parental surrogates -- after all, \nthe heirarchical and often patriarchal nature of academia makes it all too easy for everyone to buy into\nthis model of mentorship. I prefer to think of advisors as coaches: we want our team to do their best\n(and preferably win!), but most of all, we\nwant to support each team member in their professional and personal goal. Good teams are more than the sum \nof their parts, and good coaches know when to deliver tough truths and when to step out of the way. \nGood coaches also understand that getting a good game out of the team isn't about the coach. Finally, \ngood coaches understand that athletes sometimes need personal coaches and trainers, and aren't threatened \nby that. \nAre you my advisor?\nFinally, I want to make it explicit what I mean when I consider someone to be my advisee. I consider an advisee to be \nsomeone whose degree progress I am directly and strictly greater than 50% responsible for, or someone \nwhose research I directly or indirectly supervise. \nThis means that if I am on a committee that determines your fate (e.g., thesis committee or curriculum committee),\nI am not necessarily your advisor. If I agree supervise your thesis, but you never follow up, I am not \nnecessarily your advisor. If we talk about research, but either party never follows up, I am not your advisor. \nIf you aren't sure, just ask!\nAcknowledgements\nThis post is the result of culmination of many years of thinking about the power differential between adivsor\nand advisee, but most recently I owe the distinction between advising and mentoring to discussions with \nSara Kingsley.\n","id":"/musings/advising/","title":"Advising Expectations Basics"},"/musings/service/":{"body":"Reposted from an older blog.\nPeople who know me know that I am a huge proponent of treating academia \nas work. However, we do not work in a system that is particularly \ncompatible with a modern notion of labor. The following advice attempts to \nbalance how things should work (i.e., compensating people on \nthe basis of their labor) with how they actually work (i.e., the reliance \non unpaid work that is high value but not valued highly).\nWe can typically break service obligations into three categories: lab, department/college/university (internal) and external. I will discuss lab service last, since it can be the trickiest to manage.\nInternal service\nI typically encourage graduate students in their first two years to do only internal service. What is internal service? It's service work within your department/college. The benefits of doing internal service and prioritizing internal service are:\n\nIt gives students a chance to meet other students and build a support network.\nIt builds camaraderie between students who serve.\nIt (usually) gives students a chance to meet faculty who are neither their advisors nor their professors, whom they may want to ask for letters later on.\nIt can empower students to feel like they have control over their academic and immediate social environments. \nIt can be a \"trial run\" for external service. \n\nThe major theme here is using internal service as a structured way to get to learn more about a department and its norms. There are many kinds of internal service. As an example, my PhD program had the following opportunities:\n\nOrganizers of Monday Morning Coffee and Thursday Tea. These were primarily low-effort weekly social events. If you were a shy person, it was a great way to break the ice with people. \nGraduate Union Representative. This was my primary service over the years: our graduate students were unionized and serving made it easier for me to be in the loop for contract negotiations. \nSeminar organizers and volunteers. There were a variety of seminar series for different CS sub-disciplines when I was in graduate school. These seminars ranged from being entirely student-run (e.g., the Machine Learning and Friends Lunch) to entirely faculty-run (e.g., the Systems Lunch). Typically student organizers and volunteers had the chance to select and then later meet speakers. While these positions were certainly work, they were considered very desirable, due to the networking opportunities they afforded.\nGraduate representative to the faculty. This was a must-do service activity for any graduate student interested in faculty jobs. GradReps attended faculty meetings, interviewed faculty candidates, and were allowed to vote on non-RPT (reappointment, promotion, and tenure) matters. This is one of the best ways to see how the sausage of academia gets made. \n\nInternal service should immediately benefit you, the student. If you are, for example, volunteering at a seminar, but you are just doing setup and cleanup and have no special opportunitites to meet the speakers, you may want to consider putting your efforts elsewhere.\nExternal Service\nI typically recommend that students wait until they feel more secure in their position before doing external service. This might mean having published their first research paper, having reached PhD candidacy, or having completed their coursework. The reason is that stakes tend to feel higher for external service, and the load also tends to be higher. It is not uncommon to feel overwhelmed in the first year or so of graduate school, so I am a huge fan of minimizing obligations and focusing on two things in the early years: (1) building your internal PhD support network and (2) growing your expertise in your subfield. \nAt some point, every student will start to feel more confident, and that is a very good point to begin doing external service. This may happen earlier for some folks than others. Some external service obligations are more intense than others, but all external service is important for building your reputation in your resaerch community. I recommend starting to incorporate external service in the following order:\n\nStudent volunteering at conferences. Some students will begin doing this quite early. I think it can be beneficial early on to get a sense of what different research communities are like and what they work on. However, once you are sure of your research area, it is not worth being a student volunteer until you are at a point where you intend to attend conferences regularly. Once you do start attending conferences, being a student volunteer can be an easy way to meet other students. You will eventually \"grow out\" of this, though. I don't recommend being a student volunteer more than three times in your field; after that, people should start asking you to do more intensive external service. \nStudent reviewing. Different subfields have different approaches to student reviewing. In SIGPLAN conferences, students who have not published at a conference are typically introduced to reviewing via Artifact Evaluation. In ML/AI venues, where the number of submissions is very high, many conferences have started asking for students to self-nominate as reviewers. I do not recommend reviewing papers for conferences until the latter half of your PhD. \nConference/Workshop Organization. There are some annual workshops or small co-located conferences that involve student organizers, where being asked to chair that workshop or conference is considered a great honor. There are other circumstances where, e.g., you and your advisor may prepare a written proposal that you must submit for review. This kind of service is very labor-intensive and I only recommend it in the last two years of your PhD. \n\nLab service\nLab service is necessarily low-impact and can involve anything from taking notes during lab meetings, to maintaining the lab website, to mentoring junior students. Lab service can be highly beneficial to students for building camaraderie and trust. However, poorly distributed lab service can completely undermine mutual trust and respect. \nOne of the unfortunate truths of graduate school is that certain work just needs to get done, and it is simply easier for faculty to lean on \"reliable\" students they know will follow through. In a fair world, faculty would keep track of the balance between opportunitity and service and ensure that all students do their fair share, while no students are unduly burdened. Unfortunately, this is not common practice. In light of that, students must learn to advocate for themselves. This can be quite tricky, since students and faculty each have incomplete pictures of the situation. \nExploitation\nIt will always be necessary for students to stand up for themselves. The key is doing so politically. While exploitation can happen in any context, in my experience it is most egregious and difficult to manage when the parties involved know each other well: trust and familiarity are often preconditions.\nThat said, one person's exploitation is another person's opportunity -- only you can know if the situation is bad for you. \nNo matter who are you, when asked to do unpaid work, continually ask yourself: what am I getting out of this? Consider the above example, where you are doing setup and cleanup for a seminar series. If you enjoy doing this work as a break from you day, then no one should make you feel bad for not \"getting more out of it!\" Everyone finds satisfaction in different activities and it is perfectly legitimate to spend time on activities that don't translate to an impressive line on a c.v. or networking opportuntities if you find them fulfilling. \nRemember: someone who exploits your labor now, or fails to see your contributions now, is not going to write you a strong recommendation later. \nQuitting unpaid work\nQuitting service can be politically tricky. Often the folks you report to are fulfilling service obligations themselves and can fail to advocate for themselves. In such circumstances, it's probably best to not come out and say: I feel exploited. It's better to simply say: this position is no longer working for me, and I need to scale back or quit. \nIf the service obligation has no fixed end date, then you should be able to quit whenever. Term-based service obligation is usually for a fixed length of time, and you should generally try to complete your term before quitting. If you cannot, be firm in your end date. Even if the person you report to is overworked and exploited themselves, they should not be operating in an environment where the margins are so thin that one person quitting prematurely ruins everything. \nFinally, remember that in academic computer science, no one's livelihood is on the line if we have to quit a service obligation. If it were really that important, we'd be paid!\n","id":"/musings/service/","title":"Regarding Graduate Student Service"},"/musings/writing/":{"body":"The PhD is a professional degree and like all professional degrees, it prepares students for what are fundamentally jobs in communication. While the core of the work is technical — e.g., programming/coding, writing proofs, performing empirical analyses — that work is all for naught if you cannot communicate the fundamental insights and significance of your work to others. \nThis is why one of the things I always tells new graduate students is to write every day.   Many new graduate students struggle under the lack of structure, inherent uncertainty, and deep questions about motivation in their pursuit of the PhD, so I believe these skills and coping strategies can be useful for most students. \nThere are many kinds of written communication that we should all practice every day. I still have a \"write for an hour every day\" in my daily to-do lists! A timer is ticking as I write this post right now! Below I detail recommendations for various forms of writing; you should eventually consider rotating through each of them as part of your routine:\n\nJournaling\nBlogging\nTech Reports/Memos\nSocial Media\n\nI don't typically mean journaling, but that could be the right starting point for you\nFirst I'd like to get a misconception out of the way: the kind of writing you do matters, but there is no one-size-fits all advice on how you should allocate your time. I've had some students think that writing every day means journaling. \nThere are only 24 hours in a day, so think of the type of writing you choose to do in terms of the opportunity cost of not doing some other type of writing.\nExample. My undergraduate degree required a great deal of writing and I was developing a strict discipline of time-boxing via the pomodoro technique as part of a larger mindfulness practice at the start of my PhD. Thus when I started my daily writing practice, I did not need to journal, since I was more or less doing this already. Instead, I needed to focus on writing down and synthesizing my thoughts on the things I'd read, concepts I'd struggled with, and generally become more fluent in the language of scientific communication, as it was practiced in my research field. \nMy general advice is: if you already journal, or if journaling is already comfortable to do you, prioritize other writing tasks. If you struggle to get started writing at all, then by all means, journal!\nLow-stakes writing: blog posts\nI love blogging: I love doing it, I love the concept of it. What I love about it is that it is absolutely low-stakes: posts should be short (my typical length is probably 2-3 times too long!).  They should be clear and accessible. You can freely admit to not knowing things. You can try out arguments and say things that are wrong. You can take the time and space you need to really explore an idea, and you can punt on the things you don't have time to write about or think about deeply. \nStudents often feel vulnerable when they first approach blogging. I usually assure them that no one is reading their blog posts! What I am really doing when I say this is making a \"security by obscurity\" argument. Of course someone will read your blog posts eventually, but given the sheer quantity of content on the internet, no one is reading them that deeply and no one has the bandwidth, nor inclination to judge you. \nI'd also note that my most popular blog post has nothing to do with my research; it is a post with instructions on how to incorporate custom javascript in Jekyll blogs. It gets the most hits, has the most comments, and I have occassionally been tweeted at for it. One of the things I love about this is that I wrote something other people found useful, which isn't always the case with research! ;) In any case, this is all kind of cool, but goes to show that you cannot control what people will respond to. \nSo...if no one really reads your posts, what is the point? Here are what I consider the true benefits of blog posts:\nBlogging provides a way to get \"partial credit.\" Editing involves two distinct tasks: re-writing prose and removing content. \n\nRe-writing prose. It can take time to find the right pitch for your abstract and introduction. With each re-submission, the world changes a little and so it stands to reason that the way we talk about timely problems changes a little. Sometimes we become better at explaining certain concepts. Blog posts can help students (and faculty and research scientists — anyone, really!) hash out the clearest prose for a particular audience. \nRemoving content. Most venues have a page limit. The page limit ought to map to a contribution of a particular size and there ought to be thematic cohesion in the document submitted. This means that sometimes technical content gets cut. There are sometimes strategic reasons for this (e.g., some advisors advocate reducing \"surface attack area\"), but it's generally best to think about it as a communication challenge: you need to save sufficient space to explain your work and why it matters. Your objective should not be to cram as much technical content into a draft as possible. It can be hard to murder your babies, but with blogging you don't have to!\n\nPotential employers/collaborators/etc. know what you are working on. Publishing work in high-quality venues takes time. Many students in my field take over a year to submit their first paper. This is a problem when applying for internships, fellowships, etc., because it means you have no outward-facing discussions of your work. It can be quite difficult for new researchers to find venues where they can advertise and speak about their work, especially for those who started in the pandemic. Blogging is one way to make that information public. \nWriting papers gets easier. Many students struggle to write their first paper. Scientific writing uses specialized language and different communities expect papers to have different structure. In addition to the mechanics of what goes into a paper, each research community as has its own dialect. It takes time and practice to build fluency in that dialect. Just as you cannot learn a language passively, you cannot learn to write for a community passively. Lab presentations, invited talks, workshops, and more informal forms of rapid communication (e.g., talking!) are a great ways to build this fluency, which will make writing papers easier!\nBlogging as research notebook\nOne of the primary benefits of blogging your research is that it can function as prior art! Sometimes students fear being scooped. I'm not going to discuss recourse for stolen work here, but junior students should feel confident about sharing their work and establishing a record and timeline via blogging. \nHigher-stakes writing: tech memos/reports\nGood papers go through many iterations of writing, often via resubmissions. Each venue target may have a different target audience. Time matters too: tastes and attitudes about novelty and worthiness may change dramatically between submissions. \nWhat is a tech memo? A tech memo is usually longer than a blog post, and often a bit more formal. While blog posts should be fairly self-contained, tech memos need not be. A short tech memo might eventually correspond to an expanded section of a paper or an appendix. Writing the technical content of an upcoming paper submission as a tech memo can be very helpful for focusing your time and resources on the pitch closer to the deadline. Tech memos can be written as tutorials, proposals, or other forms not quite appropriate for a research paper, but helpful for explaining work done. \nWhy tech memos are useful to you and others. \n\nHow I found them useful. I wrote quite a few tech memos at the end of my PhD. They were helpful for me to work through ideas during the pandemic, when I didn't have many people to talk to. They allowed me to pull on threads that might not go anywhere and be more effective and efficient at creative thinking. \nEase into paper-writing. First papers aren't just hard because of the actual writing of sentences; it's the whole package of balancing low-level details with high-level vision, of hyping up your work while imagining how Reviewer #2 might interpret what you did, of balancing the theoretical contributions with the empirical contributions. Tech memos don't have to be all things; they can be just one (plus LaTeX practice!).\nProtect your work/contributions. Sometimes students leave academia; having a record of tech memos (whether internally or externally) can help the next student who picks up the work, while also clearly establishing you as a co-author. Lab-based tech memo repositories can help with institutional memory vis a vis prior work, preventing churn.\n\nPR-writing is the worst: social media posts \nFinally, elevator pitches for your work are incredibly important. I hate these and am very bad at them. I don't get anything out of them when other people pitch them and hate hate hate hate doing this myself. \nSomewhere (perhaps in an old Twitter account), I have a bookmarked Twitter thread about how to pitch your research on Twitter. Since I cannot find that original thread now, here is a link to an article that looks quite reasonable. \nI clearly prefer longer-form writing, which probably means I should work on my Twitter game! In any case, tweeting about work (especially in a way non-conversational way) definitely counts as writing!\nAddendum: There is no one \"right\" way to write!\nI've seen many students have anxiety about writing in graduate school. Sometimes this is because they are not native speakers and are self-conscious about their writing. Sometimes this is because their native dialect, while English, is not considered \"proper\" academic writing. I have also seen faculty handle this anxiety poorly and too often contribute to it. \nMy take is that there are two fundamental goals of writing: \n\nClearly communicate your ideas to an audience.\nSignal your membership in the in-group to that audience.\n\nMost criticism of writing is a mix of these two. I tend to deal with #1 by asking increasingly detailed questions and expressing that I am the one who is struggling to understand, but that I need their help to explain it to me. I often struggle to communicate new ideas and connections myself and try to model equal partnership in communication. \n#2 is thorny. I try to separate criticism of voice and style from community norms regarding technical content. The latter includes things the specific section titles, use of \\paragraph{&lt;Topic&gt;.} in papers, community-specific vocabulary, etc. The former is any writing that sounds like an outsider in my internal voice, but where the voice is no impediment to my comprehension. For me this includes overly pedantic requirements regarding punctuation, grammar, and diction that do not change the clarity nor meaning of the text.

I had the great fortune to intern with him at Facebook, where we investigated possible applications of static analysis to the experimental design space. While we started out focusing on generating contrasts and inferring probability of treatment assignment, we found there were errors and threats to validity of the experiments that only existed at the intersection of programs and experiments. At various points in this project, I worked with UMass folks Emery Berger and Eliot Moss on the PL side of things, and had a wonderful resource in causal inference in David Jensen. I presented this work at NEPLS in 2016 and OOPSLA 2019. It was recognized by my professional organizations via a SIGPLAN research highlight in 2020 and a CACM Research Highlight in 2021. \nCurrent work: I am currently seeking students to work on several problems related to programmatically-defined experiments, including but not limited to: robustness checks for p-hacking, type systems for interventions, integration of experiments with passive/observational data collection mechanisms and subsequent data fusion, and inference over proxy variables in systems that do not allow for intervention. In particular, I am actively developing a chimeric language for expressing hypotheses and experiments together and have several small tasks that can be carved off for students interested in getting into interdisciplinary PL research.

I designed a prototype version that my collaborators and I used to investigate the behavior of generalized agents in our work, Measuring and Characterizing Generalization in Deep Reinforcement Learning. I presented Toybox at the IBM AI Systems Day and as a poster at the 2018 NeurIPS Systems for ML Workshop. \nCurrent project: I am currently revising work that seeks to explain agent behavior in time-varying relational environments and would welcome efforts from students who might be interested in causal reasoning, experimentation, or explanation for autonomtous agents. As this work is not currently core to my research agenda, I would only consider working with exceptionally motivated collaborators on this project.

We were inspired by Basu et al.'s Property Conveyances as Programming Languages. We began by investigating two domains: arbitration agreements in EULAs and insurance contracts. We were seeking out domain experts in the legal field and have outlined projects in NLP and user comprehension of privacy concerns. Unfortunately due to delays and lack of transparency surrounding Iranian students' visa status during the pandemic, Dorsa was not able to pursue her PhD with me. \nErin McBride, now a 1L at University of Wisconsin Law School, worked with me in this space, researching contracts of adhesion and their role in changes to websites under experimentation conditions. \nCurrent Work: I have recently been able to pursue this work under the supervision of Dr. Chris Martens at Northeastern University, where I am working with students to develop usable tools for end-user comprehension and firm-side authoring of privacy policies.

This work won first place at the 2014 PLDI Student Research Competition, a best paper award at OOPSLA 2014, and a 2015 Outstanding Synthesis Award at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. UVM PhD student Michael McConnell resurrected this work with an interest in applying quantitative information flow to surveys to protect potentially vulnerable populations. \nCurrent work: As a result of serendipitous opportunitites afforded by my UVM colleagues Joe Near, I returned to this work due to the confluence of student interest in privacy, natural language processing, and biased data collection.

This was not my preferred path, but something I felt I had to do in light of some family stressors and an increasingly untenable mismatch in values between me and my institution. Thus I joined my Millennial brethren in the Great Resignation.\n\n\n\nMy current position is intentionally transitory in nature. I don't know if I will be in this role (or one like it) for three months, a year, or three years. What I do know is that, rather than seeking the impossible criteria of \"work-life balance,\" moving forward I will be seeking \"job-life balance.\" I make this distinction because while the work of being a professor is largely the same everywhere, the nature of the job differs dramatically, depending on institution. \nThough I left my professoring job, I will never stop the work: I've continued mentoring students, pursuing collaborations, and producing research results. \nIt hasn't been easy, and I stress constantly about financial stability and security, but I am making it work. \nI realize that not everyone who leaves a TT academic position can remain connected to academia. Thus, I count myself very lucky and have immense gratitude for the robust network of mentors who have given me their time, advice, an ear, and in some cases, professional connections and job opportunitites. \n\n\nWhile I haven't ruled out moving back to a tenure-track position, I do intend to be very deliberate about that process. I've described the current state of academic hiring as a bit like a shotgun wedding, when what I want is a long engagement or arranged marriage. \nI am quite fortunate that, as a US citizen, I have considerably more freedom to make choices about my employment and take my time to pursue the kind of environment where I can effectuate my goals and values. \nSo what is it exactly that I'm looking for? I've thought a lot over the years about what our ethical — rather than operational — duties are as faculty. \nWe tend to view the acquisition of faculty jobs as competitions, as prizes to be won, and because we imagine the academy to be egalitarian in nature, we think of the people in those positions as being \"worthy\" of the research (and to a much lesser degree, teaching) standards of our field. \nWe think about faculty in terms of being \"deserving\" of their jobs and this is reflected in our annual evaluations, promotion, and tenure processes. \nAll of these evaluation criteria are about catering to the standards and preferences of the people above us in the org chart. In some places there are empirical criteria; in others for better and for worse, it's fuzzier. In all places, there is an uneasy tension between how we want or imagine things to work and how they actually work. \nI would like to work in a place that carves off time to discuss and be deliberate about the bigger questions: what is the role of a university in today's world? How do we balance economic considerations with a university's mission? What are our objectives in undergraduate education? What is the purpose of graduate training? How do we convey to students the limitations of what faculty can do for them? How do we set expectations and minimize harm in our interactions with students, staff, and folks who are generally more vulnerable than we are?\nI prefer to think about the faculty job as an obligation to a community. \nFaculty positions are fundamentally service and care positions.\nTherefore, I want to be in a place that understands and promotes a care mentality from the top-down. This is something that is both exceedingly hard to measure and impossible to verify during the job search process when committees are overtaxed and undersupported. \nWhen I say \"care mentality,\" I am fundamentally talking about working in an environment that values difference and dissent. It's about promoting a growth mindset and listening mentality amongst those with power. It's about understanding that the most important part of the job is not the papers we publish or the grants we acquire, but how we spend the limited time we have and making the many hours we spend on the job worth living, because if we have a care mentality, those other empirical measures of success will come. This means being in a place where admitting you are afraid or feeling insecure is seen as a stength. It's about being in a place that takes self-compassion seriously and treats professional development on par with personal development. \nYou see, I do think there's something to the notion of being \"worthy\" of a faculty position. However, to me it's not about whether your past accomplishments caused you to beat out someone else.1 Instead it's about asking faculty to live up to the ideal of what a professor can be. Maybe it's because I don't come from an academic family and so I have a more idealized notion of what higher education is, but I think where we really fail to live up to our potential is in our collective lack of wisdom and compassion. We can't leave it up to individuals to purse these values on their own; for our work to really matter, we need to pursue them together. \nIf this resonates with you, I do have academic materials available: \n\nResearch\nTeaching\nDEI\n\nI am currently weighing some options, but I am also trying to make all decisions independently in an effort to prioritize fit and moving toward something new, rather than picking a path to avoid fear, discomfort, and uncertainty. I've compared the past two years to losing my faith; there is something sacred in what we do in higher education and whether I find my way back to the faith or learn to live without it, I will always be trying to do work that matters and pay forward the opportunities I've been given.\n1\nDon't get me wrong, I do generally love ambition and the spirit of competition, to the point where my partner won't play non-coopoerative board games with me anymore...\n\n","id":"/resignation/","title":"Leaving UVM"}},"docInfo":{"/":{"body":0,"title":0},"/about/":{"body":65,"title":0},"/biography/":{"body":173,"title":1},"/demo/":{"body":193,"title":2},"/meetings/":{"body":0,"title":1},"/musings/":{"body":106,"title":1},"/musings/advising/":{"body":785,"title":3},"/musings/service/":{"body":788,"title":4},"/musings/writing/":{"body":1007,"title":2},"/news/":{"body":241,"title":1},"/news/acsac-keynote/":{"body":16,"title":2},"/news/acsac-panel/":{"body":23,"title":2},"/news/gmu/":{"body":62,"title":1},"/news/unh/":{"body":43,"title":1},"/projects/":{"body":0,"title":1},"/projects/experiments/":{"body":145,"title":1},"/projects/explanation/":{"body":102,"title":1},"/projects/pl-law/":{"body":123,"title":1},"/projects/surveys/":{"body":114,"title":1},"/pronouns/":{"body":96,"title":1},"/publications/":{"body":0,"title":2},"/publications/adversaries/":{"body":0,"title":10},"/publications/planalyzer/":{"body":97,"title":6},"/publications/surveyman/":{"body":0,"title":5},"/publications/toybox/":{"body":0,"title":8},"/research_blog/":{"body":28,"title":2},"/resignation/":{"body":516,"title":2}},"length":27},"lang":"English"};
