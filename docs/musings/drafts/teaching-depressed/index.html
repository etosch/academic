                    <h1>The terrible pain of teaching under situational depression</h1>
                    <p>For almost a year now I've been under increasing stress at work. A lot of what I've been experiencing recently is either directly or indirectly due to the pandemic (and, according to my therapist, the patriarchy!). I currently have a blog post three months in the making about what it's been like to start a TT job during the pandemic. However, what I'm feeling most acutely right now is the daily dread of teaching. </p>
<h2 id="teaching-as-social-work">Teaching as social work</h2>
<p>I have always been too much of an empathetic person. When I was a child, my father told me not to become a social worker because the job would destroy me. I don't remember what caused him to say this specifically, but he was right — I struggle to detach emotionally from social situations and manage feelings of powerlessness when fighting a beurocracy on behalf of others. One of the challenages when teaching is that it is fundamentally a mixture of pedagogy, curation, and social work. </p>
<h3 id="first-experience-at-the-front-of-the-classroom">First experience at the front of the classroom</h3>
<p>I'd had the experience of a guest lecturing a few classes I was TAing while at Brandeis, where the class sizes ranged from 20-30 students. At the time, I thought that situation was pretty great. I'd had a soul-crushing industrial job at a small company prior to going back to school, and it was fun to teach because teaching was a way to learn and I loved sharing in that process. This was all at the end of the last recession. I remember some of the professors being quite depressed and it impacting their teaching. It was demoralizing as student. However, although I was struggling (especially financially), I was in a different place from the professors and enjoyed what I did. The students were fantastic — engaging, kind, and fun. Since I was not responsible for the class, all curation was over discretionary content. Since the students were generally in very good headspaces, there was very little social work. As a result, I had the privilege of being able to focus on the pedagogy. </p>
<h3 id="first-experience-as-instructor-of-record">First experience as instructor of record</h3>
<p>Conversely, as a graduate student, I co-taught a large (180-student) required class. I had very mixed feelings about that experience, namely due to how dehumanizing to everyone such large classes are. Because the course was required and because there were existing materials, I had very little curation I needed to do. However, because the class was very large, the number of students who were struggling was much higher. </p>
<p>During pre-pandemic times, I'd say that you can expect about 10% of your class to be struggling at any point in time. In a class of 20-30, this is only 2-3 students. In a class of 180, this is an entire class size by itself. As a TA, I'd prided myself on identifying students who were struggling very early and setting aside time to meet with them. However, as classes grew in size, I ran into the typical problem of not being able to serve everyone and in my attempts to do so, serving no one. Additionally, I found the attitudes of professors who advised me on teaching disheartening. I was told many times over that &quot;the students are not like you&quot; and to spend less time on teaching. I found the former especially disturbing because these professors often never had me as a student — and certainly never as an undergradaute — and I could feel the mismatch in experiences, values, and worldview. I did not find the latter helpful, since what took the most time was engaging with students, and disengaging felt like the abnegation of a moral obligation. </p>
<p>Additionally, this time I was (and again, situationally) depressed. The year prior, my then-advisor ended the adivising relationship<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup> and I was still dealing with the fallout of that. Things were starting to get better, but I accepted the teaching position for two reasons: (1) it paid more than being a TA, and I'd only been funded half-time the previous summer and (2) I was grateful that someone thought I was sufficiently capable of teaching that they requested me for my expertise.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#2">2</a></sup> </p>
<p>In any case, I found that, in a lot of ways, the students actually <em>were</em> like me when I was an undergraduate: they were frustrated and angry at the system and knew something was wrong, but didn't know how to articulate it. The natural impulse is to find the first responsible person and ascribe the faults in the system to them. It was well-known that required courses were the toughest to teach and I was warned ahead of time that if students did poorly, they would blame any differences from the prior semester on those differences — and having a graduate student, rather than a professor at the the head of the classroom was one such obvious difference. </p>
<p>I knew all this going in. However, what I didn't realize was terrible it felt to feel like you're constantly fucking up (even if you objectively are not) and having what felt like everyone screaming at both (sometimes) your acutal fuckups, as well as things that are completely outside of your control. I could own my mistakes, but I was also distressed over the things that upset the students that I could not change. </p>
<p>Additionally, I was struggling with depression and very concerned that it was leaking to the students. I remembered how challenging it was as a student who was paying a large sum of money for a course to feel like my professor wasn't taking the course seriously. I remember feeling like they were wasting my time and money. What I didn't know at the time was how much universities run on the margins: univerisites are landlords first and centers of learning second. Tuition doesn't fund professors' salaries so much as it keeps the lights on in the classrooms. </p>
<p>In any case, I am pretty sure we managed to handle all of those concerns, but it didn't stop the general feeling I'd had of participating in a system that is fundamentally exploitative and terrible. </p>
<h2 id="having-the-power-to-do-things-differently">Having the power to do things differently</h2>
<p>When I started this job, one thing I wanted to do differently was to teach in a way that corrected the paternalistic lecture model — one where students could learn according to their own pace and discretion, where evaluation was informative, rather than punative. Doing so while originating a course is very challenging and requires being in the right headspace. All three courses I've taught so far I've had to originate materials for. Regardless of the specifics of my circumstances, </p>
<p>I think one of the worst things about teaching while depressed is that the people who are not unhappy (and they are often people who seem to be never unhappy) don't &quot;get it,&quot; while the people who are unhappy are not in a place </p>
<p>There's no group therapy for depressed professors. </p>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="1"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p>I sometimes phrase this as his having fired me, but technically he did not fire me — had that happened, I'd've had the opportunity to file a grievance through my union. It was then that I first came to understand how little unions matter when faced with a determined employer. </p>
</div>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="2"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">2</sup>
<p>This is definitely worth a separate blog post, so I will be brief here: I am both <em>extremely</em> motivated by and suspicious of praise. Many of my formative experiences in education were punative and as a result I can be very cagey around educators. Throughout my whole life I'd found that educators and people above me in the org chart have <em>very</em> bimodal views of me: they either think I'm great or think I'm someone who needs to be put in her place. Due to the latter, I tend to be rather attached to and loyal to the former in ways that often put me in a vulnerable position, especially when the person delivering the praise is a man with power over me. </p>
