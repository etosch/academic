<p>After three semester on the tenure track, I've decided to leaave my position at UVM. I've made this choice for myriad reasons, ranging from those specific to the institution, to my feeling about the state of higher education right now. While I've experienced a range of intense emotions regarding this choice, I'm in the acceptance phase right now and wanted to reflect on that.</p>
<h2 id="walking-away-right-now">Walking away right now</h2>
<p>When I accepted my offer from UVM in February 2020, there was chatter about Covid, but having seen the hype and subsequent lack of pandemic in the US regarding SARS, Bird Flu, and Swine Flu, I didn't think anything of the situation until &quot;Safer at Home&quot; began and the stock market shut down. Then the person who recruited me to UVM left. This was a huge blow — one of the top reasons I wanted to go to UVM was because he was here. I had had a rough time during my PhD and my colleague had endured similar challenges. Furthermore, the things I'd experienced as a PhD student drove me away from my home research area (PL/SE) and I was excited to join a growing group of researchers and return to my old community. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the world has changed since then. As many have noted, things are not going well for students right now, so there is considerably more emotional labor and social work that faculty are expected to do. It's hard to teach when you feel like you are constantly failing your students. Furthermore, having moved to a new state, I left behind my social safety net and found it nearly impossible to build a new one. Some of this is due to Covid and will feel universal — it's nearly impossible to feel anything but drained when meeting new people virtually. Some of this is due to the culture in Chittenden county — I've come to realize that Vermont and Burlington in particular is a place that people go to to get away from others. </p>
<p>As things opened up again, people were more social, but I've observed their efforts were focused on their existing social ties. My whole life, I've met fascinating people in passing: on the bus, at the store, at the gym, while taking a cigarette break (back when I smoked). Here however, while I've exchanged pleasantries with folks  Thus, despite making efforts to form new relationships, I feel impossibly alone here. Yes, I live with my partner, but <a href="https://www.vox.com/22992901/how-to-find-your-community-as-an-adult">domestic partners are not a community</a>. </p>
<p>Living in Vermont was our dream. It was my dream. We used to come to Burlington for our &quot;staycations&quot; (it was our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xui7lx4wvE&amp;t=64s">Muncie</a>) and starting several years before I went on the job market, I would joke about getting a faculty job UVM and how awesome that would be. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, reality has turned out to be different. Therefore, John and I have decided that we need to leave Vermont. We need to be closer to our friends and family and people who share our outlook on life and our values. </p>
<p>Without my colleague, I had no advocate here.</p>
<p>We are not all living in the same society. </p>
