                    <p>Right now ADHD appears to be having something of a moment. I've noticed it on Twitter, with what feels like an unusual number of grown-ass adults with what look like awsome careers getting newly diagnosed and finding this diagnosis to be a revelation. </p>
<p>I am very happy for these folks. I experienced something similar when I first got my ADHD diagnosis over a decade ago. I was...24? Here is that diagnosis story:</p>
<h1 id="tale-1-getting-diagnosed">Tale 1: Getting diagnosed</h1>
<p>I won't go into the details of my childhood right now, but by the time I was in college I had been struggling with depression and anxiety for some time — or so I thought. I'd go to therapy, where I'd be told things like, &quot;you're good at therapy,&quot; or where we wouldn't really discuss my problems or things that brought me there. I'd occassionally be prescribed SSRIs for the depression and anxiety and benzodiazapems for panic attacks. I found that SSRIs <em>made</em> me depressed, but my doctors didn't believe me. I hated benzos, and became suspicious of the dosage when I became twitchy after taking them as prescribed. The only drugs I took voluntarily were my trusty Camel lights and bourban or beer (depending on the time of year).</p>
<p>My senior year in college, I was having a rough time with SSRIs again and was trying to go off them. I was sure they'd fucked with my brain. I was having a hard time staying awake, and had debilitating anxiety about leaving my room. Twice that year I'd gotten black out drunk, one time waking up in my own vomit, and the next time coming to in the toilet stall of student health services. The previous year when I was experiencing this anxiety, I'd hidden in my room for several days and even went so far as to pee in a cup and pour it out my window, I was so afraid of running into people upon leaving. </p>
<p>Anyway, my school-issued therapist sent me to the school psychiatrist during finals, where I told him what was going on. He prescribed me two meds to get me through the end of the semester: benzos (big surprise) and amphetamine.</p>
<p>Now, I had never taken amphetamine before. I knew other students who had prescriptions and they were hot messes (which is probably why we were friends? I could never maintain friendships with &quot;serious people&quot;). I also knew that there was a market for amphetamine and it seemed to flow to rich kids who partied on it or used it to cram.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#2">1</a></sup> I had also read <em>On the Road</em> in high school during my lunch breaks when I worked at Wawa and very much feared this drug as a result. </p>
<p>So I went and I filled the two prescriptions. During a prior meeting with a therapist or shrink — the details are fuzzy now — I'd been told that I didn't need to take the benzos consistently, that my prior doctor was not correct in that. Instead, I was told to consider them a safety net, and that sometimes just knowing that you have them can help. </p>
<p>I ended up talking to a mentor about the amphetamines and disclosed that part of the reason I was afraid of them was because I was afraid I would like them and become addicted. I'd been offered cocaine before and declined, as I saw what it did to people. I also struggled to quit smoking and reduce my caffiene intake, so I worried that I'd go overboard with these drugs. He told me I didn't have to take them if I didn't want to, but I was likely prescriped a theraputic dosage and if I wanted to see if they helped, I should not be afraid of becoming addicted, but also that I had a safety net if I felt out of control. </p>
<p>I won't go into the details of my childhood right now, but I was your typical 90s/early aughts depressed and misunderstood teen. I was, naturally, considered &quot;weird,&quot; and was moderately rebellious. I started smoking cigarettes at age 16 and generally &quot;had problems with authority.&quot; I started out as a fairly &quot;good kid&quot; but was always putting my foot in my mouth and getting in low-grade trouble without meaning to. At some point I decided, fuck it, if I'm going to feel like crap all the time because I can't fit in this box, I'm going to act out and enjoy the fruits of rebellion. </p>
<p>I fundamentally like me. I try very hard to be kind to others and abhor cruelty. That said, I sometimes struggle to be &quot;nice,&quot; typically when being nice stands in opposition with the truth and most especially when nice &quot;conflicts&quot; with &quot;just.&quot;</p>
<p>One consequence I've faced and have come to terms with is that because I speak directly and plainly, I will sometimes offend. I will sometimes say things in a way I don't mean and as a result I've learned to have humility and ask for forgivenness </p>
<p>I have deep distrust in institutions and systems. While I have felt comfortable disclosing certain life events and struggles to various supervisors over the years — especially when I've felt there is an acceptable social framework for doing so — I have never disclosed my ADHD diagnosis. This stems from having disclosed personal issues to friends and colleagues before, and it ending the relationship.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">2</a></sup> </p>
<p>I have deep distrust in institutions and systems. While I have felt comfortable disclosing certain life events and struggles to various supervisors over the years, I have never disclosed my ADHD diagnosis. Some of this stems from lessons I learned earlier in life where I reached and do not believe that </p>
<p>As a child I played piano and I used to get up at 5:30 in the morning to practice. While I was practice, I'd often let my mind wander and one of things I'd think about </p>
<p>I am certain that at times I annoy the crap out of other people and I do try to be mindful of how I interact with others. I've learned </p>
<p>Many of the stories are about how certain things make sense now and I am very happy for people who have this revelation. I've also seen discussions of </p>
<p>I'm writing this because if there is a single vocal minority that most &quot;neurotypicals&quot; see, then that minority comes to define what this label means. I am especially concerned </p>
<p>[:1] All my life, I've found that people readily disclose deeply personal information to me. I used to find this very odd, as I've never been a good listener (although I have  practiced over the years and suspect I've actually succeeded at becoming better at listening, since my current crop of friends now assure me that I am a very good listener, despite my anxieties and protestations).</p>
<p>[:2] Anecdotally, I've found the assertion that amphetamine is a &quot;study drug&quot; to be quite dubious. I always found the elusive &quot;good night's sleep&quot; to be the best preparation for an exam, but to each his own. Plus, wouldn't it be a more effective use of the drug to take it <em>during</em> the exam? Wouldn't using it to cram exhaust you beforehand? Or maybe people do both? This world of high-end and strategic substance abuse was always very foreign to me, as someone who often struggled with basic functioning. </p>
