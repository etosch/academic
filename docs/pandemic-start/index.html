                    <p>It's currently January 2022 and the academic job market is in full swing. There are many promising new graduates on the market, as well as some very exciting post-docs. It pains me that I cannot read all your papers and academic materials and engage with you on your extremely cool research visions. </p>
<p>You undoubtedly know that being an assistant professor means having no time. I can certainly attest to that. In fact, as I write this on a timer to bound my investment, I have to ask myself: why, when I'm working 14hr days, am I bothering to do any longform writing? Wouldn't I prefer to go to bed at a reasonable hour? Wouldn't be better for my relationship if I made dinner for once? Why do I post on Twitter when I woefully behind on nearly everything? </p>
<p>The answer, dear reader, is that I feel a deep knot my stomach and a stone in my heart. I don't know how much longer I will last in this job and one of the things I can do to make my time here worth it is to try to help those who come next succeed. </p>
<p>As we enter Covid Year 3, I thought I'd share my experiences on what it's been like to start this job during a pandemic. Some of the items in here </p>
<p>The worst part of the job isn't actually the hopelessness of feeling like you can't change anything. It's the feeling that </p>
<p>Some people are excellent at speaking their truth. This is wonderful and we certainly need more of that. Someday I hope we can celebrate speaking truth to power the same way. </p>
