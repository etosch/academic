This blog contains all of my writing that is _not_ about research. 

During graduate school I had the privilege of a thoughtful, socially-conscious, 
and engaged group of friends and colleagues with whom I could talk about both 
research and the socio-ethical issues we all faced. The pressures of faculty
life &mdash; especially under the conditions of Covid-19 &mdash; mean that I 
lost this part of my life upon starting my faculty position. 

This blog is something of a substitute for that community and those conversations. 
It is meant to be casual and conversational. I write from experience and observation 
only &mdash; I will almost certainly have no expertise in any of the topics I discuss
and know I really ought to read more background from people who think deeply about things. 
I welcome pointers to readings in the comments. 

I view this blog as a kind of theraputic progression of what I'm thinking about regarding
various topics over time. My opinions and interpretations almost certainly will change
with time. There will almost certainly be bad and uninformed opinions in here 
somewhere. I don't expect to write about deeply contentious topics, but in the event 
that I do, I expect my policy to be that I update posts with revised thoughts and 
acknowledgement of harm.
