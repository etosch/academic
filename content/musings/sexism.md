Okay so despite the click-baity title, I want to start by saying: it would be
super awesome if this just like...weren't an issue at all. My ideal world is 
one where we view individual gender expression as myriad and variable and fairly
orthogonal to everyday interactions. 

That said, this is not the world we live in. I've been thinking lately about 
Now, I'm not a sociologist or gender theorist and like 

Use of "guys"

Being called "Mrs." 

Being asked to do "feminine things" like administrivia.  



 given the choice between old school overt sexism and what I'm calling
the more "modern" sexism, 10 out of 10 times, I'd take the old school variety.

What do I mean by "modern" sexism? This is the sort of the behavior 

Most of my adult life I've spent in heavily male-dominated work environments. 
These are places 

Here I want to distinguish between gender and masculine/feminine. Gender is 
something 

Maybe it would be easier and clearer to use a different dichotomy that is 
less likely 

Masculine sexism vs. feminine sexism 
Order vs. Chaos
Light vs. Dark
Raw vs. Cooked
Hot vs. Cold
Equal and opposite

Dr. Cox we are all men. 

It's important here to differentiate
