**Background:** Early in my PhD, I designed a table-based programming language and runtime system to design, debug, and deploy scientific surveys on the web. With my project adivsor, I collaborated with folks from the Linguistics department. I first presented [SurveyMan](https://surveyman.emmatosch.com) at the 2014 Off the Beaten Track workshop. This work won first place at the 2014 PLDI Student Research Competition, a best paper award at OOPSLA 2014, and a 2015 Outstanding Synthesis Award at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. 

**Current Project:** I am now collaborating with UVM PhD student [Michael McConnell](https://www.uvm.edu/~mvmcconn/) on applying quantitative information flow to surveys to protect potentially vulnerable populations.
